✨ Thanks for contributing to the **Solana Block Explorer**! ✨

As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:
* Ensure `yarn lint` passes before submitting a Pull Request
* Commits follow the [Angular commit convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)

We use [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)
to release new versions automatically from the `master` branch:
*  Commits of type `fix` will trigger bugfix releases, think `0.0.1`
*  Commits of type `feat` will trigger feature releases, think `0.1.0`
*  Commits with `BREAKING CHANGE` in body or footer will trigger breaking releases, think `1.0.0`

All other commit types will trigger no new release.
