    #### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

An `if let` pattern attempts to match the pattern, and enters the body if the
match was successful. If the match is irrefutable (when it cannot fail to
match), use a regular `let`-binding instead. For instance:

```
struct Irrefutable(i32);
let irr = Irrefutable(0);

// This fails to compile because the match is irrefutable.
if let Irrefutable(x) = irr {
    // This body will always be executed.
    // ...
}
```

Try this instead:

```
struct Irrefutable(i32);
let irr = Irrefutable(0);

let Irrefutable(x) = irr;
println!("{}", x);
```
