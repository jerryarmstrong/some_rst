    This error indicates that the compiler cannot guarantee a matching pattern for
one or more possible inputs to a match expression. Guaranteed matches are
required in order to assign values to match expressions, or alternatively,
determine the flow of execution.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0004
enum Terminator {
    HastaLaVistaBaby,
    TalkToMyHand,
}

let x = Terminator::HastaLaVistaBaby;

match x { // error: non-exhaustive patterns: `HastaLaVistaBaby` not covered
    Terminator::TalkToMyHand => {}
}
```

If you encounter this error you must alter your patterns so that every possible
value of the input type is matched. For types with a small number of variants
(like enums) you should probably cover all cases explicitly. Alternatively, the
underscore `_` wildcard pattern can be added after all other patterns to match
"anything else". Example:

```
enum Terminator {
    HastaLaVistaBaby,
    TalkToMyHand,
}

let x = Terminator::HastaLaVistaBaby;

match x {
    Terminator::TalkToMyHand => {}
    Terminator::HastaLaVistaBaby => {}
}

// or:

match x {
    Terminator::TalkToMyHand => {}
    _ => {}
}
```
