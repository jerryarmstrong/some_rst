    # Move bytecode to llvm bitcode compiler

Takes move bytecode in text or binary format

See: `move-mv-llvm-compiler --help` for cli.

Compile move-bytecode to llvm bitcode

## Overview

The move compiler uses llvm-sys to interface with llvm. It translates stackless bytecode representation of move to llvm-ir.
Read more about bytecode translations from [here](https://github.com/move-language/move/issues/817) and [here](https://brson.github.io/2023/03/12/move-on-llvm#challenges-of-porting-move)

The [docs](./docs) directory contains the documentation. Interesting links:

- [Move to llvm compiler](./docs/MoveToLLVM.md)
- [Project stages](./docs/MoveToLLVM.md#project-stages)

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

- Parts of [inkwell](https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell) code has been copied to this subfolder.
It will be rewritten based on the needs of the project. If exact code is to be adopted, they will be
put in a sub folder with appropriate acknowledgement.

- The [ziglang codebase](https://git.sr.ht/~andrewrk/ziglang/tree/master) has examples of LLVM C API that has been helpful.
