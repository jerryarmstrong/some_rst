David's Renaissance combines traditional drawing techniques with digital software to generate 8,138 unique collection of NFTs. Just as Michelangelo's first strike into marble ushered in the renaissance -- NFTs mark an important moment in art history: the clash between art ownership and internet culture. Our collection is a nod to one of the greats and is manifested through a digital collectable. Each minted David provides the holder with a unique floating bust of David. Certain Davids will have rarer attributes than others, with some even redeemable for physical artwork. After the plague comes the Renaissance, this is a conversation about culture. Welcome to the digital Renaissance.
