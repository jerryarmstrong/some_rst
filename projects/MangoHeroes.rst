Mango Heroes is an NFT project built on the Solana blockchain that aims to bridge the gap between crypto traders and NFT communities. We strive to foster a greater sense of community for investors, enthusiasts, and traders alike in order to increase the user base and success of the Mango Markets protocol.

With the help of the Mango Markets team, our project will become the new NFT avatars for the protocol as we continue to build applications and tools on top of the existing frameworks created by the Mango Markets protocol.
