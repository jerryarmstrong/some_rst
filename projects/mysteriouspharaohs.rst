Mysterious Pharaohs NFT is the collection of 4,444 programmatically generated ancient-style characters protecting the SOLANA TREASURE.
Each of the 4,444 Mysterious Pharaohs is generated from over 200 different hand-drawn traits. The Egyptian pharaohs are shrouded in mystery. What are their origins? What are they looking for? For the time being, all we know is that they are guarding the SOLANA TREASURE, which you can obtain by minting your own Pharaoh.
Join us on a thrilling adventure to uncover more mysteries and take part in the Treasure Hunt!
