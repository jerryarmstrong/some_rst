Flux is an NFT art project on Solana, committed to high quality & unique long form generative art.
We're focused on building a great community & minting beautiful art for them to own & enjoy. 
Our first art drop is Evolutions and our vision is to expand the platform to attract our favourite generative artists to Solana.
