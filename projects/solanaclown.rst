Solana Clown is a collectioan of unique, automaticaly generated NFTs on Solana blockchain. 
More than 200 assets were designed and developed all in order to create a product that we are really proud of.

Every single NFT looks clean and absolutely stunning. Clowns have their own character and life story, some of them were beaten-up, 
and some are fresh and self-confident.
