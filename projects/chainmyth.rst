Chain Myth is a 5v5 first-person hero shooter game with MOBA mechanics and a play-to-earn model.
The game's theme is inspired by Indian culture, with the superpowers of their Gods and Goddesses’ as the main design points behind ChainMyth’s characters.

Characters are tokenized as NFTs and introduced to unlock all the 14 gods and goddesses in-game. Stake your digital asset, unlock the heroes and weapons, 
and enter the battle arena. Fees for ranked games and hosted tournaments will be distributed to NFT owners.
