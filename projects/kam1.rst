The mythical world of Izuno knew no strife, felt no hunger, and knew only bliss for centuries. That all changed when the demons attacked. Led by the Demon King, the Yokai razed the kingdoms of Izuno and enslaved its citizens. The few remaining prayed to the KAM1 for help, offering their very souls. The KAM1 have heard their prayers and have sent down 8888 of their elite warriors. The fight has begun.
