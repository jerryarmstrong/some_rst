Fennecs were once alone and lost in the desert, trying to survive human invasion. But a group gathered together and founded the most thuggish & unexpected association.

The Fennec Thug Association is a collection of 1,175 randomly generated & unique art pieces carefully hand drawn and selected by our beloved artist. There are over 250 possible attributes, some rarer than others.

Join us on our journey & experience where the Wild West meets the Sahara Desert and Cuteness meets Thuggery.

Holding a Fennec ensures you a place of choice in our association and juicy rewards through the redistribution of royalties.
