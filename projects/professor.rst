Professor .finance is a decentralized community based on Solana blockchain. We use SPL token standards for our non-fungible tokens. Each character NFT on our platform is individually designed with attention to detailing. Our NFT characters range from common characters to super rare character such as The professor, which will 10-20% expensive as compared to regular NFTs. Users are encouraged to try their luck. Initially we will offer 8760 NFTs. Each NFT minted by users is a randomly generated character totally by chance. Users can mint up to max 5 characters at a time. Users can participate in our Minoberries by holding their character NFTs for at least a period of 15 days. Users can also implement their idea regarding the execution, location and date of minoberries by conducting a poll among the community using their governance tokens.
