    // Regression test for an ICE that occurred with the universes code:
//
// The signature of the closure `|_|` was being inferred to
// `exists<'r> fn(&'r u8)`. This should result in a type error since
// the signature `for<'r> fn(&'r u8)` is required. However, due to a
// bug in the type variable generalization code, the placeholder for
// `'r` was leaking out into the writeback phase, causing an ICE.
