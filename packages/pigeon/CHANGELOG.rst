  front-end parser and the Dart generator (unsupported languages ignore the
  designation currently).

  classes.

## 1.0.15

* [java] Fix too little information when having an exception

## 1.0.14

* [tests] Port several generator tests to run in Dart over bash

## 1.0.13

* [ci] Starts transition to a Dart test runner, adds windows support.
* [front-end] Starts issuing an error if enums are used in type arguments.
* [front-end] Passes through all enums, referenced or not so they can be used as
  a work around for direct enum support.

## 1.0.10

* [front-end] Made sure that explicit use of Object actually creates the codec
  that can represent custom classes.

## 1.0.9

* [dart] Fixed cast exception that can happen with primitive data types with
  type arguments in FlutterApi's.

## 1.0.8

* [front-end] Started accepting explicit Object references in type arguments.
* [codecs] Fixed nuisance where duplicate entries could show up in custom codecs.

  the output (generated class and codec).

## 1.0.6

* Updated example README for set up steps.

## 1.0.5

* [java] Fixed bug when using Integer arguments to methods declared with 'int'
  arguments.

## 1.0.4

  only show up in type arguments.

## 1.0.3

* [objc] Updated assert message for incomplete implementations of protocols.

## 1.0.2

* [java] Made it so `@async` handlers in `@HostApi()` can report errors
  explicitly.

## 1.0.1

* [front-end] Fixed bug where classes only referenced as type arguments for
  generics weren't being generated.

## 1.0.0

* Started allowing primitive data types as arguments and return types.
* Generics support.
* Support for functions with more than one argument.
* [command-line] Added `one_language` flag for allowing Pigeon to only generate
  code for one platform.
* [command-line] Added the optional sdkPath parameter for specifying Dart SDK
  path.
* [dart] Fixed copyright headers for Dart test output.
* [front-end] Added more errors for incorrect usage of Pigeon (previously they
  were just ignored).
* [generators] Moved Pigeon to using a custom codec which allows collection
  types to contain custom classes.
* [java] Fixed NPE in Java generated code for nested types.
* [objc] **BREAKING CHANGE:** logic for generating Objective-C selectors has
  changed. `void add(Input value)` will now translate to
  `-(void)addValue:(Input*)value`, methods with no arguments will translate to
  `...WithError:` or `...WithCompletion:`.
* [objc] Added `@ObjCSelector` for specifying custom objc selectors.

## 0.3.0

* Updated the front-end parser to use dart
  [`analyzer`](https://pub.dev/packages/analyzer) instead of `dart:mirrors`.
  `dart:mirrors` doesn't support null-safe code so there were a class of
  features we couldn't implement without this migration.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** - the `configurePigeon` function has been migrated to a
  `@ConfigurePigeon` annotation.  See `./pigeons/message.dart` for an example.
  The annotation can be attached to anything in the file to take effect.
* **BREAKING CHANGE** - Now Pigeon files must be in one file per invocation of
  Pigeon.  For example, the classes your APIs use must be in the same file as
  your APIs.  If your Pigeon file imports another source file, it won't actually
  import it.

## 0.2.4

* bugfix in front-end parser for recursively referenced datatypes.

## 0.2.3

* bugfix in iOS async handlers of functions with no arguments.

## 0.2.2

* Added support for enums.

## 0.2.1

* Java: Fixed issue where multiple async HostApis can generate multiple Result interfaces.
* Dart: Made it so you can specify the BinaryMessenger of the generated APIs.

## 0.2.0

* **BREAKING CHANGE** - Pigeon files must be null-safe now.  That means the
  fields inside of the classes must be declared nullable (
  [non-null fields](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/59118) aren't yet
  supported).  Migration example:

```dart
// Version 0.1.x
class Foo {
  int bar;
  String baz;
}

// Version 0.2.x
class Foo {
  int? bar;
  String? baz;
}
```

* **BREAKING CHANGE** - The default output from Pigeon is now null-safe.  If you
  want non-null-safe code you must provide the `--no-dart_null_safety` flag.
* The Pigeon source code is now null-safe.
* Fixed niladic non-value returning async functions in the Java generator.
* Made `runCommandLine` return an the status code.

## 0.1.24

  null values.

  backslashes in `import` statements.

## 0.1.12

* Fixed assert failure with creating a PlatformException as a result of an
  exception in Java handlers.

* Added flag to generate null safety annotated Dart code `--dart_null_safety`.

## 0.1.10+1

* Updated the examples page.

## 0.1.10

* Fixed bug that prevented running `pigeon` on Windows (introduced in `0.1.8`).

## 0.1.9

* Fixed bug where executing pigeon without arguments would crash (introduced in 0.1.8).

## 0.1.8

* Started spawning pigeon_lib in an isolate instead of a subprocess.  The
  subprocess could have lead to errors if the dart version on $PATH didn't match
  the one that comes with flutter.

## 0.1.7

* Fixed Dart compilation for later versions that support null safety, opting out
  of it for now.
* Fixed nested types in the Java runtime.

## 0.1.6

* Fixed unused variable linter warning in Dart code under certain conditions.

## 0.1.5

  types directly, without an enclosing class.
