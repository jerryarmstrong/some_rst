    # image\_picker\_windows

A Windows implementation of [`image_picker`][1].

### pickImage()
The arguments `source`, `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, `imageQuality`, and `preferredCameraDevice` are not supported on Windows.

### pickVideo()
The arguments `source`, `preferredCameraDevice`, and `maxDuration` are not supported on Windows.

## Usage

### Import the package

This package is not yet [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin), which means you need to add 
not only the `image_picker`, as well as the `image_picker_windows`.
