    ## 0.3.3+4

* Reverts an accidental change in a constructor argument's nullability.

## 0.3.3+3

## 0.3.3

* Removes unused Flutter dependencies.

## 0.3.2

* Improve web implementation so it can stream larger files.

## 0.3.1+5

* Unify XFile interface for web and mobile platforms

## 0.3.1+4

* The `dart:io` implementation of `saveTo` now does a file copy for path-based
  `XFile` instances, rather than reading the contents into memory.

## 0.3.1+3

* Fix example in README

## 0.3.1+2

* Fix package import in README
* Remove 'Get Started' boilerplate in README

## 0.3.1+1

* Rehomed to `flutter/packages` repository.

## 0.3.1

  implementations to avoid potential analyzer issues.

## 0.3.0

* Migrated package to null-safety.
* **breaking change** According to our unit tests, the API should be backwards-compatible. Some relevant changes were made, however:
  * Web: `lastModified` returns the epoch time as a default value, to maintain the `Future<DateTime>` return type (and not `null`)

## 0.2.1

* Prepare for breaking `package:http` change.

## 0.2.0

* **breaking change** Make sure the `saveTo` method returns a `Future` so it can be awaited and users are sure the file has been written to disk.

## 0.1.0+2

* Fix outdated links across a number of markdown files ([#3276](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/pull/3276))

## 0.1.0+1
