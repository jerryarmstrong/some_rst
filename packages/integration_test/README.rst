This package has [moved to the Flutter
SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/master/packages/integration_test),
and the pub.dev version is deprecated.
As of Flutter 2.0, include it in your pubspec's
dev dependencies section, as follows:

```
dev_dependencies:
  integration_test:
    sdk: flutter
```
