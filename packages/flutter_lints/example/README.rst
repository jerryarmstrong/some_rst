    An example project that showcases how to enable the lint set from
`package:flutter_lints`, which contains recommended lints for Flutter apps,
packages, and plugins.

The `flutter_lints` packages is listed as a dev_dependency in the `pubspec.yaml`
file.

The lint set provided by the package is activated in the `analysis_options.yaml`
file. The lints enforced for this project can be further customized in that
file.

The Dart code in this project (e.g. `lib/main.dart`) is analyzed using the
lint configuration provided by `package:flutter_lints`.

The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in IDEs with Dart support or
by invoking `flutter analyze` from the command line.
