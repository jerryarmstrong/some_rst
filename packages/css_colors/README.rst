    CSS Colors
==========

This package defines color constants for the CSS colors. These color constants
use the [Color](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart-ui/Color-class.html) class
from `dart:ui`, which means they're useful for Flutter apps.

Import
------

```dart
import 'package:css_colors/css_colors.dart';
```

Use
---

```dart
new Container(color: CSSColors.orange)
```
