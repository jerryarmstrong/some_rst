Orca is the easiest way to exchange cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain. Here, you can exchange tokens with minimal transaction fees and lower latency than any DEX on Ethereum, all while knowing that youâ€™re getting a fair price. Additionally, you may provide liquidity to a trading pool to earn a share of trading fees.
