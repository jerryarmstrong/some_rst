Dreamverse is a world in the metaverse with various seasons and dimensions of urban and natural environments, possibilities of future and alternative realities. 
It is the culmination of hard work and collaboration from project leads who guided this journey to support three digital artists’ imaginative dreamscapes. 
The artists, each with a distinct style, came together to fuse their unique expression with AI assistants. Each artist worked with an individualized AI assistant, 
which the AI team specifically designed to complement defining characteristics of each artist. This experimental environment allowed digital artists and their AI assistants to work together. 
Learning and adapting were iterative processes for the artists and AI agents throughout this project. In total, the artist-AI pairs created 6,180 pieces of NFTs. 
During their artistic process, they discovered new possibilities in their art – which culminated in the harmony of the DreamVerse. 
The artists and three AI assistants built a digital collection with endless possibilities of storytelling through scenes and images that trigger the imagination. 
May it inspire new possibilities of creative expression at the intersection of art and technology in the metaverse.
