The world of the Terrestial T-Rex Club is facing a great danger of extinction. The earth is trembling, volcanos are erupting and the sun darkens day by day due to meteor showers. Because of their great diversity of talents, there is hope. Some dedicate their life's work to science, others build fortifications for defense and few endure the brutal heat to salvage parts. 
In order to protect their world and existence, all T-Rexes need to work together as a team. A successful joint mission to stop the meteors will lead to great rewards from the Terrestial T-Rex Club.
