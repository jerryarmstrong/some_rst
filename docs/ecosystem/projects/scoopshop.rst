The Autonomous Scoop Shop is a collection of 750 cool and delicious NFT treats, staying frosty on the Solana blockchain.
We used the latest and greatest in realtime rendering technology to build a fully dynamic generative 3D art system, which allows us to do some pretty neat stuff.
10% of all proceeds, including future royalties, will be donated to The International Child Art Foundation, to support creative programs for global youth.
