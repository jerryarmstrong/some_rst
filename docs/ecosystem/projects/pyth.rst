Pyth Network is an oracle network built by some of the biggest names in traditional finance and DeFi, providing the infrastructure for DeFi to support reliable, institutional-grade market data oracles. Pyth is focused on continuous data originating off-chain and disseminating it at sub-second speeds, while maintaining advanced security.

Institutional-grade market data oracles are lacking in DeFi. Pyth is focused on finding a new and cheaper way to bring high-fidelity financial services data on-chain and aggregate it securely.
