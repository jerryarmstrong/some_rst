Currently, there is no easy, non-technical interface for end-users to exchange services or bid for responses from specific user groups on the blockchain. Polarity implements a protocol which enables regular consumers to cryptographically represent themselves with a pseudonymous identity in order to interact with others and fairly exchange information or other specific services.

Traditional Web 2.0 practices involve an agreement that provides a user's internet data for sophisticated advertising, tracking, and data mining. In the end, regular consumer data is given for free and the only thing received in return is permission to interact with a website. There is more money exchanged for our personal data than we might think, and this data is cleverly used to favor some and discriminate others.

Polarity's goal is to secure user data and unethical solicitation of personal details.
