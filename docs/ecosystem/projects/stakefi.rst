StakeFi is a cross-chain staking derivatives protocol. We firmly believe that the future of DeFi is cross-chain, and are therefore exploring how to help stakes in different PoS networks communicate with each other.

Eventually with StakeFi, not only will users and investors enjoy a fixed income from network inflation, but they will gain access to liquidity and yield in a cross-chain environment.
