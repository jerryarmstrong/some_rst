Oxygen is a DeFi prime brokerage service built on Solana and powered by Serum's on-chain infrastructure, centered around Pools, or baskets of assets that take collective actions. Starting with a borrow-lending facility, users earn yield and get leverage against their portfolios, setting the foundation for a vibrant and decentralized financial ecosystem.

It allows for a more efficient use of assets in three key ways:

1. Multiple use of the same collateral - Oxygen enables you to generate yield on your portfolio through lending out your assets  
   and borrowing other assets at the same time.
2. Cross-collateralization - Portfolios can be used as collateral when you want to borrow other
   assets, allowing for lower margin call/liquidation risk for portfolios.
3. Market-based pricing - Our protocol is order-book based, opting not to follow a manually adjusted, pre-set market model. This means we offer the fairest price for borrowing and lending every time.
