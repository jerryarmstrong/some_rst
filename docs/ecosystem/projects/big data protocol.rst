Big Data Protocol tokenizes commercially valuable data through a network of 14,141 professional data providers and makes the data token liquid on Uniswap. Users earn data by providing liquidity to data tokens.

1. Source data from professional data providers
   The Protocol enjoys access to 14,141 professional data providers.

2. Tokenize the data
   The Protocol mints data tokens called bALPHA for the first collection of curated datasets. There are only 18000 bALPHA tokens.

3. Users farm the data token in the Data Vaults
   Users earn the data token by providing liquidity in Uniswap to bALPHA and to BDP, the access token for the Protocol.

4. Users redeem data token for datasets in the Data Room
   Burn 1 bALPHA to access the underlying datasets.
