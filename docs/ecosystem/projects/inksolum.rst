Our project is focused on the beauty of art and the possibilities offered by blockchain and solana to discover, share, value and exchange it. We have a long-term goal of building a community of both artists and collectors that can experiment with emotional art and push it to their bounderies.

The collections are based on different themes but with a common topic: different cross-cultural phenomenon that has been present in human groups for a long time. We will touch them in different ways without losing the essence of art, which is no other than expressing or comunnicating our mental states in a shared subjective context.

We have a dynamic mentality and enjoy experimenting with different techniques and processes (both automated and manual ones) without giving up on our vision of art. Our work is framed within the so-called generative art.
