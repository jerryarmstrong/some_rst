Sypool is a synthetic asset management protocol which enables you to build, manage, and trade portfolio tokens easily. This idea was inspired by off-chain fund companies and packaged asset derivatives. On the one hand, we tokenize fund shares. On the other, this share token actually represents a small part of a multi-token pool, thus providing the scarce liquidity for the cryptocurrency market. Migrating finance off-chain to on-chain is a milestone for decentralized asset management.
