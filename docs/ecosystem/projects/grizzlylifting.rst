Grizzly Lifting University is a collection of 3333 generative Bears NFTs on Solana with hundreds of variants from their fur type to their clothing, to their accessories.
Don't be fooled though, these bears may love to lift but they dabble in genetic experimentation. In attempts to continue their reign as the most superior species on earth, 
these bears will go to extreme lengths!
