Portals is a web-based metaverse platform that we’ve been working on this year that we’re really excited to finally reveal and bring to the Solana ecosystem.
We started building Portals in early 2021 because we didn’t see a compelling and accessible metaverse emerging on the web.

We want to be able to explore a dense, virtual Neo-Tokyo/New York and explore a single city block with hundreds of fun things to do and discover. 
We are building a framework so that everyone is incentivised to invite cool people and create cool spaces for a thriving downtown.

Real estate and token incentives will be distributed in a way that ensures a dense, interesting city center for new users to explore. Instead of big land sales,
we’re starting with user experience first to build a grassroots community of builders and players.
