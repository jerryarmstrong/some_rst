xHashtag enables fractional ownership of tokenized #hashtags purchasable by locking $XTAG tokens into a bonding curve contract that controls price in relation to supply of #hashtags and guarantees liquidity. The protocol burns #hashtags based on their performance on Twitter, increasing floor price over time. xHashtag is a powerful Twitter marketing tool for crypto projects, driving consistent conversation and traction while incentivizing fans.
