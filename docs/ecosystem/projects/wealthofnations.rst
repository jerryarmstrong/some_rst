Become the leader you were always destined to be

This strategy game doesn’t get any more real than this – for the first time ever on the Solana network, real economics laws are applied, 
and YOU have the full ownership of the in-game cryptocurrency and NFTs involved in this real-world simulation.

Our team has achieved the most accurate economics simulation of the Middle Ages period. As a player, you will be facing the same issues that they faced back then, 
which were nightmares for the leaders of that time. It’s not just about conquering land and resources – it’s much more than that.

Corruption, smugglers, being tempted by inflation and other tricks that world leaders have pulled before – the possibilities are endless. 
The invisible hand of the market will come in play in a several different ways, which makes Wealth of Nations the most interactive game of its kind! 
Don’t let those aspects scare you though – even a child can manage his own state because we’ve made in-game advisers available to the leaders that need some help… But beware, 
as those brats love getting a slice of your pie.

We’ve spent years (yes, years) checking out every economical aspect of the game in every possible environment just so that we could deliver the most realistic economic simulation. 
We now have onboarded design wizards to make our vision come to life in line with modern user experience and beautiful design.
