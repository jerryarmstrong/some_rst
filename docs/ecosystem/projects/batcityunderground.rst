Bat City Underground is the first linear animated sitcom to exist on and be born from the Solana blockchain. BCU is an adult animated sitcom about a struggling band living in the underground city of New Bat City. In this universe, in a cave deep under Central Park, like the human world above it, the world is filled with nocturnal characters that roam the night, searching for a good time and cheap thrills; escaping their demons and fears; finding love in between one night stands. Like Bojack Horseman, 
BCU will ask questions about existentialism, purpose and meaning of life, all while featuring original music from known artists, guest stars, and hilarious scenarios. Stay tuned!
