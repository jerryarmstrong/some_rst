Jambo Mambo is a project that builds with NFTs to bring together a community of gaming enthusiasts and creators. We will start with the Origin Drop, 
and the rest of Jambo Land and $Snacko-system will follow as outlined in the Roadmap above!

We are building in public; creating great experiences is our MO, therefore our community’s ideas and input is absolutely essential. 
In the future, some prime decisions will be made by JamboDAO votes, and our infrastructure for circulating in-game revenue and enriching Jambo Mambo’s ecosystem will be put to use.
