Circlepod is a global application, the goal is to build a media metaverse ecology, through our unique media agreement to lead players into a new experience. Allow Podcaster to interact directly with the audience and get paid directly. We encourage and accelerate the change and development of the global digital creation, so that every piece of creation can get its due value. Create more interactivity and entertainment. Connect fans and value through blockchain, and create a good copyright and subscription ecosystem through data and AI.
