Many stories of blockbuster heroes were born in some corporate building in Hollywood, then polished through hours of boring meetings... This is not one of them.

Lazy Heroes came to life after hours talking, laughing and farting on discord.

It's a cartoonesque collection of 2,000 uniquely generated lazy characters - wannabe heroes, inspired by pop-culture, 90's tv shows, memes and the crypto-sphere.

EVery asset has been carefully hand-drawn with love, and we plan on launching a comic book telling little funny stories about those lazy heroes .
