Kaiju Cards’ first phase will be a collectible-backed, browser-based RPG built on Solana. 
Think Neopets meets DeFi. Starting soon after the initial sale, we’ll be rolling out a character and item store,
a trading marketplace, several dungeons complete with loot progressions, and collection contests.
Over time, more and more complex features will be added, giving the player more ways to engage and progress. 
Non-linear strategies will thrive, and players will have to figure out what works best for them. Min/maxers rejoice.
