Soldex looks to solve issues faced by order-matching centralized exchanges and trustless custody within current decentralized exchanges.
The soldex.ai protocol will power the new wave of flexible financial markets by serving as a foundation layer for settlement, market making, custody and liquidity. New waves of market makers will own unique algorithms, customize their trading strategy, and adjust their desired risk exposure, all while keeping custody of their funds.
