    # solana-flagged-accounts

A community maintained registry of flagged accounts

## How is this repository used?

Solana's blockchain explorer (https://explorer.solana.com/) uses this registry to inform users about accounts flagged as potential scams.

## How can I contribute?

  1. Modify `flagged.txt` by adding the address to be flagged on a new line.
  2. Create a pull request with your changes (https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
  3. Submit reasoning and evidence for why an account should be flagged (e.g. a screenshot, url, telegram channel).
