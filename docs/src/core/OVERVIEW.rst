# Solana Pay

`@solana/pay` is a JavaScript library for facilitating commerce on Solana by using a token transfer URL scheme. The URL scheme ensures that no matter the wallet or service used, the payment request must be created and interpreted in one standard way.

## Why use Solana Pay

Businesses and developers can use Solana Pay to accept payments in SOL or any SPL token without intermediaries. It offers frictionless and portable integration options like payment links, pay now buttons or QR codes on your app, dApp, website, blog, and so much more.

## Getting Started

Learn how to integrate Solana Pay in your website, application or wallet.

### Transaction Requests

A Solana Pay transaction request URL describes an interactive request for any Solana transaction. The parameters in the URL are used by a wallet to make an HTTP request to compose any transaction.

### Transfer Requests

A Solana Pay transfer request URL describes a non-interactive request for a SOL or SPL Token transfer. The parameters in the URL are used by a wallet to directly compose the transaction.
