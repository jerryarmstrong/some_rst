TPU (Transaction Processing Unit) is the logic of the validator
responsible for block production.

![TPU Block Diagram](/img/tpu.svg)

Transactions encoded and sent in UDP packets flow into the validator
from clients (other validators/users of the network) as follows:

* fetch stage: allocates packet memory and reads the packet data from
the network socket and applies some coalescing of packets received at
the same time.

* sigverify stage: deduplicates packets and applies some load-shedding
to remove excessive packets before then filtering packets with invalid
signatures by setting the packet's discard flag.

* banking stage: decides whether to forward, hold or process packets
received. Once it detects the node is the block producer it processes
held packets and newly received packets with a Bank at the tip slot.

* broadcast stage: receives the valid transactions formed into Entry's from
banking stage and packages them into shreds to send to network peers through
the turbine tree structure. Serializes, signs, and generates erasure codes
before sending the packets to the appropriate network peer.
