This code defines a custom error type called `UploadError` for handling various errors that may occur during the upload process in the Sugar project. The `UploadError` enum is derived from the `Debug` and `Error` traits, which allows it to be easily printed and used as a standard error type.

There are eight different error variants in the `UploadError` enum, each representing a specific error scenario:

1. `InvalidAssetsDirectory(String)`: This error occurs when the provided assets directory is invalid. The error message includes the invalid directory path.
   
2. `GetExtensionError`: This error occurs when the code fails to get the file extension from the assets directory.

3. `NoExtension`: This error occurs when there is no file extension for a given path.

4. `InvalidNumberOfFiles(usize)`: This error occurs when the number of files in the assets directory is not even. The error message includes the invalid number of files.

5. `Incomplete(String)`: This error occurs when the upload process is incomplete. The error message includes a description of the incomplete part.

6. `SendDataFailed(String)`: This error occurs when sending data fails. The error message includes a description of the failure.

7. `MismatchValue(String, String, String, String)`: This error occurs when there is a mismatch in the value of a property in a file. The error message includes the property name, file name, expected value, and found value.

8. `AnimationFileError(String)`: This error occurs when a metadata file is not formatted correctly for animations. The error message includes the problematic file name.

These error variants can be used throughout the Sugar project to handle specific error scenarios during the upload process. For example, when validating the assets directory, the code might return an `UploadError::InvalidAssetsDirectory` error if the directory is not valid.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `UploadError` enum and how is it used in the project?
   **Answer:** The `UploadError` enum is a custom error type that represents various errors that can occur during the upload process in the Sugar project. It is used to provide more specific and descriptive error messages when handling errors related to uploading assets.

2. **Question:** What is the `thiserror` crate and how is it being used in this code?
   **Answer:** The `thiserror` crate is a Rust library that simplifies the process of implementing the `std::error::Error` trait for custom error types. In this code, it is being used to derive the `Error` trait for the `UploadError` enum, allowing it to be used as a standard Rust error type with custom error messages.

3. **Question:** How are the error messages defined for each variant of the `UploadError` enum?
   **Answer:** The error messages for each variant of the `UploadError` enum are defined using the `#[error()]` attribute provided by the `thiserror` crate. The attribute takes a string literal as its argument, which can include placeholders (e.g., `{0}`, `{1}`) that will be replaced with the values of the enum variant's fields when the error message is generated.
