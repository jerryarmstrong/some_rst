This code is a utility module for the Sugar project, providing various helper functions to interact with the Solana blockchain and SPL tokens. It includes functions to get the connected cluster environment, validate SPL token addresses, and interact with candy machine creators and metadata accounts.

`get_cluster` function takes an `RpcClient` as input and returns the connected cluster environment (Devnet, Mainnet, or Unknown) based on the genesis hash.

`check_spl_token` and `check_spl_token_account` functions are used to validate SPL token addresses. They take a `Program` and an input string, and return a `Result` indicating whether the input is a valid SPL token or token account.

`spinner_with_style`, `wait_with_spinner_and_countdown`, and `progress_bar_with_style` functions are used to create and customize progress bars and spinners for the command-line interface.

`get_dialoguer_theme` function returns a `ColorfulTheme` for use with the `dialoguer` crate, which is used for creating interactive command-line prompts.

`assert_correct_authority` function checks if the user's keypair matches the update authority of the candy machine.

`f64_to_u64_safe` function safely converts a floating-point number to an unsigned 64-bit integer.

`get_cm_creator_metadata_accounts` and `get_cm_creator_mint_accounts` functions retrieve metadata and mint accounts associated with a candy machine creator, respectively. They take an `RpcClient`, a creator string, and a position as input, and return a list of `Pubkey`s.

`get_cm_creator_accounts` is a helper function used by the above two functions to fetch candy machine creator accounts based on the provided filters.

These utility functions can be used throughout the Sugar project to interact with the Solana blockchain, validate user inputs, and provide a better user experience with progress bars and interactive prompts.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_cluster` function and how does it determine the environment of the connected RPC?
   **Answer:** The `get_cluster` function is used to determine the environment (Devnet, Mainnet, or Unknown) of the connected RPC. It does this by comparing the genesis hash of the connected RPC with the predefined constants `DEVNET_HASH` and `MAINNET_HASH`.

2. **Question:** How does the `check_spl_token` function validate if the given input is a valid SPL token mint address?
   **Answer:** The `check_spl_token` function first converts the input string to a `Pubkey` and then fetches the account data associated with that `Pubkey`. It checks if the length of the account data is 82 bytes, and then unpacks the data into a `Mint` object. If the mint object is initialized, it is considered a valid SPL token mint address.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `get_cm_creator_metadata_accounts` and `get_cm_creator_mint_accounts` functions, and how do they differ?
   **Answer:** Both functions are used to fetch Candy Machine creator accounts based on the provided creator address and position. The `get_cm_creator_metadata_accounts` function returns a list of metadata account `Pubkey`s, while the `get_cm_creator_mint_accounts` function returns a list of mint account `Pubkey`s. They both internally call the `get_cm_creator_accounts` function, but process the results differently.
