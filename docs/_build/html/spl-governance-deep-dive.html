<p># SPL Governance Deep Dive</p>
<p>This is a more technical article about the SPL Governance topic. It’s meant for anyone interested in understanding
the Realms system in detail and for anybody planning to integrate with SPL Governance.</p>
<p>## SPL Governance</p>
<p>The SPL Governance is [a Solana blockchain program](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance</a>)
developed as part of the [Solana Program Library](<a class="reference external" href="https://spl.solana.com/">https://spl.solana.com/</a>), meaning the program is developed by guys from Solana Labs.
The program’s purpose is to provide a blockchain-based tool to manage [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao">https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-dao</a>).</p>
<p>The SPL Governance is designed in a generic manner to cover a good number of use cases for DAO management.
The cornerstone of functionality covers creating proposals containing blockchain instructions that DAO members may vote upon,
and on successful voting, the instructions may be executed.
A simplistic use case could be to use the system to create a multisig control over the distribution of DAO funds.
A heavier use runs smooth DAO management through created instructions that can be voted on by the community and/or council,
which consists of minting tokens, transferring funds from the DAO treasury, upgrading the code of programs belonging to the DAO,
and administering the managed programs.</p>
<p>## Where to find, how to get</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This article refers to SPL Governance in version 3.1
[released in December 2022](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/releases/tag/governance-v3.1.0">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/releases/tag/governance-v3.1.0</a>).</p>
<p>The program of [SPL Governance](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/README.md">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/README.md</a>)
is part of the Solana Program Library at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/governance-v3.1.0/governance">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/governance-v3.1.0/governance</a>.
A shared instance of the program is deployed at <cite>GovER5Lthms3bLBqWub97yVrMmEogzX7xNjdXpPPCVZw</cite>.
While [it’s recommended](<a class="reference external" href="https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/945282322318655528/1079728429697597462">https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/945282322318655528/1079728429697597462</a>)
for DAO in many cases to do [own deployment](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/governance-v3.1.0/governance#1-dao-owned-instance">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/governance-v3.1.0/governance#1-dao-owned-instance</a>)
of the program. That way, you can take the code from the repository and publish it to the network with a unique address.
An advantage of such an approach is that the DAO can manage timing and details of the upgrade of the SPL Governance program,
a disadvantage could be that the DAO has responsibility to maintain the program.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For your own deployment, use <cite>Anchor</cite> verifiable build.</p>
<p>SPL Governance provides a UI to do DAO management easily. That’s available at <a class="reference external" href="https://app.realms.today/realms">https://app.realms.today/realms</a>
(to work on devnet, add [<cite>?cluster=devnet</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://app.realms.today/realms?cluster=devnet">https://app.realms.today/realms?cluster=devnet</a>) into address bar).
The source code of the UI is available at the repository: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-ui">https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-ui</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When the own deployment of the program is done, the new address should be configured in the UI, into a list of known instances.
That mostly means [creating a PR](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-ui/pull/1534">https://github.com/solana-labs/governance-ui/pull/1534</a>) with the configuration.</p>
<p>To integrate the SPL Governance into your own application, you can use the Typescript SDK under the Oyster repository
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/tree/main/packages/governance-sdk">https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/tree/main/packages/governance-sdk</a>.</p>
<p>## Other resources</p>
<p>A good complementary resource to this article could be the official
[README of the governance program](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/README.md">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/README.md</a>)
at GitHub.</p>
<p>Then a nice technical description of the SPL Governance system can be found at sec3 article

A nice governance UI tutorial is available at [PsyFi documentation page](<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.psyoptions.io/psy-token-and-dao/governance-tutorials/governance-overview-and-walkthrough">https://docs.psyoptions.io/psy-token-and-dao/governance-tutorials/governance-overview-and-walkthrough</a>).</p>
<p>## Terms and glossary</p>
<p>The terms used within the SPL Governance system are a bit ambiguous in some places,
so let’s pin some of them to clarify their meaning and not miss you in the rest of the text.</p>
<p>### DAO vs. Realm</p>
<p>The term <cite>realm</cite> is used at multiple places within the texts and documentation
of the SPL Gov system. At some perspectives, it can be considered the equivalent of DAO,
in cases, a DAO may consist of several <cite>realms</cite>. Let’s elaborate.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, the <cite>Realm</cite> is the top level wrapper of configuration setup for DAO.
In this context, the [<cite>Realm</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs</a>)
is the top level data structure of the program that all other data structures refer to.</p>
<p>If the DAO, as the organization itself, requires specific configuration for their voting, then
such a decentralized organization could create multiple <cite>Realms</cite>, all belonging to one decentralized organization.
But such a configuration is rather exceptional. It’s usual that a DAO is managed within one <cite>Realm</cite>.
For that, it’s usual to consider the terms <cite>dao</cite> and <cite>a realm</cite> equivalent in the SPL Governance system.
It’s the reason why the <cite>governance-ui</cite> uses both terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>### Governance vs. DAO Wallet</p>
<p>The term governance is ubiquitous. You can find it in the name of the library; the purpose of the program is to
__govern__ the DAO. Thus, eyes looking into the repository will reach the
[governance](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs</a>)
term naturally and quite promptly. From a code perspective, it’s a data structure that defines the content of the Solana account.
It’s strictly bound to one <cite>realm</cite> (one realm consists of multiple governances).
Governance contains a set of configuration parameters for voting over proposals.
On top, the governance determines a strictly unique address of
[DAO wallet](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/native_treasury.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/native_treasury.rs</a>).
It’s a Solana account that holds native SOL owned by <cite>System Program</cite>, created as a PDA seeded by the governance account address.
The SPL Governance program names the DAO Wallet with the term <cite>native treasury</cite>.
Any transaction executed on behalf of a particular Realm falls under one particular governance
where the DAO wallet address (<cite>native treasury</cite>) may be used as a fee payer.</p>
<p>The UI differentiates between governance and the DAO wallet, but it’s important to know that these terms are tightly coupled
and could be considered synonymous.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is highly recommended to utilize the address of
[the DAO wallet](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/NOTES.md#dao-wallet">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/NOTES.md#dao-wallet</a>)
(i.e., <cite>native treasury</cite>) as the authority for managing any assets under the <cite>Realm</cite>.
This includes matters such as a mint authority, a token owner authority, or a contract custom admin authority with permission to make configuration changes.
While using the governance address for these purposes is possible, it is not considered a best practice.</p>
<p>### Proposal</p>
<p>It’s a submission represented by a poll where voters place their pro or con attitudes. When the poll successfully passes,
the proposal is considered successful, and if the submission contains a transaction, it can be executed to seal the resolution of the voting.</p>
<p>Every proposal belongs under one particular governance. The resolution of voting depends on the number of votes gained,
while thresholds of success are defined in the configuration of the governance.</p>
<p>A voter is represented by a wallet containing tokens that identify the voter’s voting power.</p>
<p>## SPL Governance account structure</p>
<p>The Governance account structure is documented
[in the repository](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance#program-accounts">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance#program-accounts</a>).
But let’s take a look at the account hierarchy in more detail. We will start with a picture of all available accounts, and then
have a description of them.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/spl-gov-account-structure.png “Realm account data structures”)</p>
<p>The top-level account (representing a DAO, as explained above) is
[the <cite>Realm</cite> account](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L124">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L124</a>).
The address of the realm account is
[calculated as a PDA address](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L125">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L125</a>)
identified by its name. There cannot be two realms with the same name, the name cannot be changed while a display name is used
for example, in the Governance UI
[can be modified](<a class="reference external" href="https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/964818745786789898/1093478043382722580">https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/964818745786789898/1093478043382722580</a>).</p>
<p>The realm is defined by two groups of voting population: <cite>council</cite> and <cite>community</cite>.
Each voting population configures its <cite>mint</cite>. The field of <cite>community_mint</cite> can be defined only at the time of creation and cannot be changed later.
Members of the population have the ability to create a proposal with or without instructions for execution upon successful voting.
The creator of the proposal establishes the voting population. Only members of the voting population can vote on the particular proposal.
For example, when a proposal is created for the council to vote on, only council members are eligible to vote.
However, members of the community population may veto the proposal (when permitted in configuration).</p>
<p>The most of the configuration of the <cite>Realm</cite> is held in a separate Solana account with the name
[<cite>RealmConfigAccount</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L80">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L80</a>).
This account is pointed from <cite>Realm</cite> at the field <cite>realm_config</cite>. This account split is the result of Solana’s inability to support
account size changes in the past.
The <cite>RealmConfigAccount</cite> specifies the type of token (liquid, membership, dormant/disabled) used for a specific group of voters
or plugin usage for voter weight calculation (e.g., VSR plugin).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Despite the <cite>community_mint</cite> cannot be changed after the Realm is created it’s possible to apply plugin functionality like
[Voter Stake Registry (VSR)](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry">https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry</a>) that open a way to configure the mint later.</p>
<p>In addition, the realm encompasses other configuration parameters, including the rule for when a new governance instance can be created.
A new governance instance can be created either when the instruction is signed by the Realm’s <cite>authority</cite> address,
or by a council member who owns at least one token, or by a community member who possesses enough voting power
as specified in the Realm configuration.</p>
<p>The realm groups a few or multiple [<cite>Governance</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L80">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L80</a>) accounts.
Governance is a basic configuration unit that defines limits for creating proposals, voting time, thresholds, and if voting may be finished before
voting time elapses (known as <cite>vote tipping</cite>), if vetoing proposals is permitted,
and ultimately sign the transactions to be executed using governance and native treasury (DAO Wallet) keys.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Similar to all other accounts listed here, the governance account is a PDA account.
It is seeded with the realm address and a <cite>governance_seed</cite>. Previously, the <cite>governance_seed</cite> was a public key of the governed program,
but this concept is now considered obsolete. The <cite>governance_seed</cite> should be treated as an arbitrary public key
used solely to seed the governance account address. The <cite>Governance</cite> has the ability to manage any asset,
whether it be a token, program, or other, and is not limited to a single governed program address.</p>
<p>The next part of the account structure hierarchy is the
[<cite>Proposal</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L105">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L105</a>)
The proposal is created within one particular governance.
A proposal is bound to a single mint (<cite>governing_token_mint</cite>) that defines the population (council or community) that may vote for it.
The proposal consists of several options (determined by a string label) that the voting population can choose from. There is an optionally defined
instructions for particular options that are executed when the option passes successfully.
After creation, the proposal goes through a lifecycle defined by [several states](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L101">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L101</a>). The lifecycle state designates permitted operations
over the proposal — only at certain states can the proposal be cancelled, voted for, transaction execution run, etc.</p>
<p>Then the <cite>Proposal</cite> might or might not be linked with some instructions that will be executed when the proposal passes successfully through voting.
The list of instructions is defined in one or multiple
[<cite>ProposalTransaction</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs</a>)
accounts. The account consists of a list of public keys that are expected to be provided at the time of <cite>Execution</cite>, the transaction call data, and then
[metadata and configuration](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L86">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L86</a>).</p>
<p>### Different types of governances</p>
<p>When one checks the SPL Governance program in version 3.1, she may notice that different types of governance can be created.
Those are the
[mint, program and token](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L126">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L126</a>)
governance account types.
All of those are
[considered deprecated](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/NOTES.md#asset-specific-governances-are-deprecated">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/NOTES.md#asset-specific-governances-are-deprecated</a>)
but as of now they are heavily used within Governance UI (because of
[technical limitations](<a class="reference external" href="https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/910566058740568094/1098293000028831824">https://discord.com/channels/910194960941338677/910566058740568094/1098293000028831824</a>)).</p>
<p>## Lifecycle of a proposal</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/spl-gov-proposal-states.png “Proposal states”)</p>
<p>As said before, the proposal goes through a lifecycle defined by several states. Let’s take a look at them in more detail.</p>
<p>### Draft</p>
<p>A new proposal is created in <cite>Draft</cite> state. The proposal consists of a set of options (each of which is determined by a string label
and an index in the array where it’s stored).
When in <cite>Draft</cite> state, the creator of the proposal may require multiple signatories for the proposal. That’s done with
[<cite>AddSignatory</cite> instruction](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L162">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L162</a>).
The proposal moves to <cite>Voting</cite> state only when all signatories sign the “drafted” proposal (we consider the “drafted” proposal one in <cite>Draft</cite> or <cite>SigningOff</cite> state).
That way, one may ensure that the proposal won’t leave the “drafted” state until all defined signatories confirm that the proposal is prepared
to be voted on (i.e., until not ready to take votes).</p>
<p>Calling the <cite>AddSignatory</cite> instruction is not required, but for moving the proposal to <cite>Voting</cite> state, at least the signatory of the creator is required.
When a signatory has been appointed by calling the <cite>AddSignatory</cite> instruction, the signature of the creator is not demanded
for the proposal to move to the <cite>Voting</cite> state.
When a first signatory signs the proposal by calling the <cite>SignOffProposal</cite> instruction the proposal moves to the <cite>SigningOff</cite> state
and no more signatory can be added.
When all signatories (or the creator herself) sign the proposal, the proposal moves to the <cite>Voting</cite> state.
That’s done immediately with execution of the last <cite>SignOffProposal</cite> instruction.</p>
<p>Until the proposal is in the <cite>Voting</cite> state, one can call the  <cite>InsertTransaction</cite> to bound a set of instructions to an option in the proposal.
Options are stored in an array structure in the <cite>Proposal</cite> account and each is defined by an index.
The index is passed on execution of the <cite>InsertTransaction</cite> instruction to determine which option the instructions are bound to.
The call may be repeated with the same option to bound multiple instructions to it.
As well, the instructions can be grouped into an array of instructions that are executed atomically.
The inserted [set of instructions](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/blob/040b7c89f757846f64c2436dbb58ecc4db8c5837/packages/governance-sdk/src/governance/withInsertTransaction.ts#L14">https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/blob/040b7c89f757846f64c2436dbb58ecc4db8c5837/packages/governance-sdk/src/governance/withInsertTransaction.ts#L14</a>)
is stored in
[a transaction account](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L102">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L102</a>)
and at the time of execution, the
[<cite>ProcessExecuteTransaction</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_execute_transaction.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_execute_transaction.rs</a>)
takes the transaction account and executes the instructions stored in it.
The address of the transaction account is calculated from
[the proposal public key, index of the option and index of the instruction](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/blob/040b7c89f757846f64c2436dbb58ecc4db8c5837/packages/governance-sdk/src/governance/accounts.ts#L1241">https://github.com/solana-labs/oyster/blob/040b7c89f757846f64c2436dbb58ecc4db8c5837/packages/governance-sdk/src/governance/accounts.ts#L1241</a>).</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> On creating a proposal, there is deposited
[a certain amount of SOLs](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_create_proposal.rs#L188">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_create_proposal.rs#L188</a>)
to custody of the Governance system. The amount increases based on the number of currently active proposals.
The deposited amount
[can be refunded](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_refund_proposal_deposit.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_refund_proposal_deposit.rs</a>)
to the creator when the voting on the proposal is finished.
The reason is to prevent spamming the governance system with proposals that are not going to be voted on.
It’s the benefit of UI that such maintenance operations are handled automatically.</p>
<p>### Voting</p>
<p>When all signatories were added, all transactions are in place and every signatory has been acknowledged by call of
[<cite>SignOffProposal</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L168">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L168</a>),
then the proposal is moved to the <cite>Voting</cite> state.
In this state, the proposal is ready to take votes.
The voting population of the <cite>council</cite> or <cite>community</cite> may vote on the options of the proposal. They can vote <cite>Yes</cite> for the option,
or cast <cite>deny</cite> (<cite>No</cite>) votes against it or may vote to <cite>Abstain</cite>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The voting is done by calling</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>[<cite>CastVote</cite> instruction](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L171">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L171</a>).
Voting time is defined by
[<cite>voting_base_time</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L43">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L43</a>)
governance attribute and can be prolonged by setting-up
[<cite>voting_cool_off_time</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L65">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L65</a>).
At <cite>voting_cool_off_time</cite> period, the user may only cast negative votes (<cite>deny</cite> and <cite>vetoes</cite>) or relinquish his vote.
The voting may be finished before the voting time elapses when
[<cite>vote tipping</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L45">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L45</a>) is enabled.</p>
<p>The voter may change his mind and cast another vote. That has to be done by first calling the
[<cite>RelinquishVote</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L175">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L175</a>)
that removes the voting power from the option, and then a new vote can be cast.</p>
<p>When the voting time elapses and the proposal is not tipped to be finished sooner, one needs to call
[<cite>FinalizeVote</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L173">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L173</a>)
instruction for the proposal being moved to <cite>Succeeded</cite> (a non-final) or <cite>Defeated</cite> (a final) state.
The <cite>FinalizeVote</cite> instruction checks the number (precisely the weight) of <cite>Yes</cite> votes
and the number of <cite>deny</cite> votes at all options of the proposal and considers the
[type of the proposal](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L144">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L144</a>)
and then decides the result.</p>
<p>The workflow for <cite>Veto</cite> votes is a bit different. The proposal is moved to the final <cite>Vetoed</cite> state when the veto threshold is met.
This is checked at every <cite>CastVote</cite> call, regardless of whether <cite>vote tipping</cite> is enabled or not.</p>
<p>During the time the proposal is in the <cite>Draft</cite> state or under <cite>Voting</cite> state the proposal may be cancelled.
When it happens, the proposal is moved to a final <cite>Cancelled</cite> state.
Only the owner of the proposal is permitted to call the instruction [<cite>CancelProposal</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L177">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L177</a>).
The term owner means a token owner record account (see below) that was inserted into the proposal account on its creation.</p>
<p>The [proposal option](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L54">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L54</a>)
successfully passes when the option gains at least the weight of votes equal to
[<cite>community/council_vote_threshold</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L32">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/master/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L32</a>)
configured as a parameter in <cite>Governance</cite>, and the weight of positive <cite>Yes</cite> votes is higher than the weight of deny <cite>No</cite> votes.
The same weight of the positive (<cite>Yes</cite>) and weight of the deny (<cite>No</cite>) votes is a tie, and the result vote for the option is resolved as <cite>Defeated</cite>.
The proposal passes when at least one option has succeeded.</p>
<p>### Finalization</p>
<p>When the proposal ends in the <cite>Succeeded</cite> state, then instructions bound to the successful options may be executed.
Besides the proposal’s final state, each option marks its final state separately.
Only those options that were marked as [<cite>Succeeded</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L41">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L41</a>) (i.e., not <cite>Defeated</cite>) may execute attached instructions with the call of [<cite>ExecuteTransaction</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L196">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/mod.rs#L196</a>).</p>
<p>The governance may be configured with [<cite>min_transaction_hold_up_time</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L37">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/governance.rs#L37</a>), which defines the minimum time that the instruction execution has to wait after the proposal voting ends.
Every transaction holds the configuration parameter
[<cite>hold_up_time</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L99">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal_transaction.rs#L99</a>)
that cannot be lower than the minimum configured at governance (but it can be higher), it is defined by the creator of the proposal
and it sets the final time that the proposal has to wait before the instructions can be executed.</p>
<p>When all instructions are executed, the proposal is moved to the final [<cite>Completed</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L121">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L121</a>) state.</p>
<p>There is one more eventuality of the end state when the instructions from the proposal fail to be executed.
That could happen because of wrongly composed instructions (e.g., wrong accounts passed to the instruction),
the state of the blockchain changed since the proposal was created and the constraints
for the instruction executions cannot be met anymore or more other reasons.
In that case, the proposal may be marked as
[<cite>ExecutingWithErrors</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L121">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/enums.rs#L121</a>)
by calling the <cite>FlagTransactionError</cite> instruction (called by the proposal owner).</p>
<p>## Survey type proposals</p>
<p>There is one special “type” of proposal that goes through the lifecycle slightly differently than usual proposals.
We used the word “type” in quotes because it is not a real type of the proposal but just a proposal with specific attributes.
When you create a proposal without any instructions attached to it and the deny voting
[is not permitted](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_create_proposal.rs#L40">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_create_proposal.rs#L40</a>),
it is considered a survey-type proposal.</p>
<p>The survey-type proposal has no effect on the state of the blockchain (no instructions)
thus it is used to just collect the opinion of the community.</p>
<p>The survey-type proposal does not progress to the <cite>Succeeded</cite> state and immediately moves to the <cite>Completed</cite> state when the voting ends.</p>
<p>## Voting and Locking Tokens</p>
<p>We have discussed the data structures and workflow of SPL Governance but have not yet touched on the topic of voting. Who can vote on proposals
and how is the voting power calculated?</p>
<p>The voter must be the owner of the tokens. A <cite>realm</cite> is created with the definitions of <cite>community</cite> and <cite>council</cite> mints. Ownership of the token
gives the right to vote on proposals. Voting power is calculated as the ratio of the locked number of tokens owned by the voter
and the maximum voter weight of tokens for the mint.
The maximum voter weight could be considered the total supply of tokens for the mint.
That’s strictly true for <cite>council</cite> token. For community tokens, one can configure the <cite>realm</cite> attribute
[community_mint_max_voter_weight_source](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L43">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm.rs#L43</a>)
where beside the total supply of tokens
[the max voter weight](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L519">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L519</a>)
could be defined as an absolute number or as a fraction of the total supply.
The other option to configure this is to use the add-ins (see below).</p>
<p>Beside that, the <cite>realm</cite> configures
[a token type consideration](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L21">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L21</a>).
If the token type is <cite>membership</cite> then the token is controlled by the <cite>realm</cite>. The token cannot be transferred to another wallet.
When the token type is <cite>liquid</cite> then the token can be freely transferred and traded, the mint authority is controlled either by <cite>realm</cite> or
by any other entity. The <cite>dormant</cite> token type says the voting population is disabled in the <cite>realm</cite>.</p>
<p>For the voter to employ their voting power, they must lock the tokens to the <cite>realm</cite>. This is done by
a [deposit call](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_deposit_governing_tokens.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_deposit_governing_tokens.rs</a>). The tokens are locked until any active proposal on which the voter voted exists.
For the owner to withdraw the funds, he has to wait until the voting period ends or when he relinquishes his votes.</p>
<p>The SPL Governance creates an account [<cite>token owner record</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/token_owner_record.rs#L33">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/token_owner_record.rs#L33</a>) for each voter (more precisely, for every wallet).
This record keeps track of how many tokens were locked, as well as the number of active proposals
that the voter has voted for and the number of unrelinquished proposals to determine whether a withdrawal is possible.</p>
<p>The number of locked tokens under the <cite>token owner record</cite> determines the voting power of the owner of the record.
The owner may delegate this voting power to another wallet by setting it up
[the delegate field](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/token_owner_record.rs#L80">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/token_owner_record.rs#L80</a>)
in the <cite>token owner record</cite>.
Only one delegate can be defined per token owner record.</p>
<p>### Vote record</p>
<p>[Casting a vote](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_cast_vote.rs#L31">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_cast_vote.rs#L31</a>)
means to add voting weight to the proposal option.
The voter can choose to vote for or against the proposal.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>NOTE:</strong> the voting logic of the abstain vote is not implemented, despite the type is available in the contract,</dt><dd><p>and for this reason is not shown  the UI.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The type of vote is defined by the
[<cite>Vote</cite> enum](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/vote_record.rs#L48">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/vote_record.rs#L48</a>)
and passed as an argument in the
[cast vote instruction](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_cast_vote.rs#LL34C14-L34C14">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/processor/process_cast_vote.rs#LL34C14-L34C14</a>).</p>
<p>When a voter casts their vote, information about this action is written to two places in the Solana blockchain.
First, the proposal account is updated with the summary of the
[weight of votes](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L60">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/proposal.rs#L60</a>) for each option.
This information is used during proposal finalization (the <cite>vote records</cite>, see below, are not used for this purpose).</p>
<p>Second, a [<cite>vote record</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/vote_record.rs">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/vote_record.rs</a>)
account is created. This record gathers information such as the casted voting weight, type of vote, etc. The existence of the record attests
that a vote has been cast from a particular <cite>token owner record</cite> for a particular proposal.
The <cite>vote record</cite> is used to prevent double voting and for historical purposes.</p>
<p>## Plugin System (Add-ins)</p>
<p>The SPL Governance Program is designed to be extensible. In version 3.1, there are two available extension points:
[<cite>voter weight</cite> and <cite>max voter weight</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/addin-api/README.md">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/addin-api/README.md</a>)
add-ins.</p>
<p>The configuration of the realm defines that there is an add-in to be used for any calculation of
[the voting power (voter weight) and max voter weight](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L64">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/blob/governance-v3.1.0/governance/program/src/state/realm_config.rs#L64</a>).
This way, the voting power cannot depend solely on the number of locked tokens at the mint
but mostly anything can be used for the calculation.</p>
<p>For the reference one can check the [Voter Stake Registry](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry/">https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/voter-stake-registry/</a>), a VSR plugin,
managed by Blockworks Foundation. The VSR plugin is used to calculate the voting power based on the amount of SOL tokens locked in the VSR contract
and permits multiple mints to be used for voting weight calculation.</p>
<p>## Governance UI</p>
<p>You most likely use the web-based UI as the primary point of interaction with the SPL Governance program.
Therefore, we will conclude this article with a brief overview of the discussed concepts in the context of the UI.</p>
<p>### Creating a Realm</p>
<p>When you navigate to [the Realms page](<a class="reference external" href="https://app.realms.today/">https://app.realms.today/</a>) , you can see the list of existing realms.
Clicking on the <cite>Create DAO</cite> button presents you with three options to choose from:</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/01_creating_dao.png “Creating DAO, three options”)</p>
<p>All three options present a walkthrough wizard where different default parameters are predefined,
and a different set of parameters has to be provided. The <cite>Multi-Signature</cite> wallet option creates
a <cite>Realm</cite> where only the council is expected to vote, and the community is not enabled. The <cite>NFT Community DAO</cite> option creates
a <cite>Realm</cite> where voting power comes from ownership of NFTs. It is a voter weight plugin that provides functionality
for voting power calculation. The <cite>Community Token DAO</cite> is meant for community-driven DAOs
where both the <cite>council</cite> and <cite>community</cite> are enabled.</p>
<p>When a <cite>Realm</cite> is created, the main Realm configuration page is presented. When you change some config,
it is usually done via a configuration page that ends up creating a <cite>proposal</cite>.
The proposal is a usual way to change the configuration of <cite>Realm</cite> and <cite>Governance</cite>.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/02_main_screen_with_desc.png “Main configuration screen”)</p>
<p>Let’s discuss the most important parts of the UI:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>My governance power</strong> - After connecting the wallet, the user can deposit tokens to the <cite>Realm</cite></dt><dd><p>and manage their delegation of voting power, withdraw tokens, and check on their created proposals.
The <cite>My Proposals</cite> button shows proposals that the token owner has voted for, including active and unrelinquished ones.
The menu names the _unrelinquished <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">proposals_</span></a> as <cite>Unreleased Proposals</cite>. To withdraw tokens, the user has to
to relinquish all proposals (i.e., the <cite>Release All</cite> button).
Even for finished proposals, the user has to do the <cite>unrelinquish</cite> action to withdraw tokens.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/03_01_my_governance_power.png “My governance power screen”)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Params</strong> - This section shows the parameters of the <cite>Realm</cite> and allows for changes. The user can change</dt><dd><p>the configuration of the <cite>Realm</cite> (stored in <cite>RealmConfigAccount</cite>) in the top right corner by clicking on <cite>Config -&gt; Change Config</cite>.
All <cite>Governance</cite> instances are listed below, and the voting settings can be changed by clicking
on the <cite>Change Config</cite> button. There are other tabs on the right side of the list of <cite>Governance</cite> instances,
including <cite>Accounts</cite>, where the user can list all related accounts to the Governance.
The <cite>Accounts</cite> tab lists the <cite>native treasury</cite> wallet, ATA token wallets managed by the governance, and program accounts
or a mint, if available.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/04_02_parameters.png “Realm parameters screen”)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>DAO Wallets</strong> - This section provides a different perspective on the <cite>Governance</cite> accounts.</dt><dd><p>Importantly, the user can create a new Governance instance by clicking on the <cite>New DAO wallet</cite> button.
The list below the button represents the addresses of the <cite>native treasury</cite> wallets (every <cite>Governance</cite> has one).
To add an asset to a wallet, the user can click on the <cite>Add Asset</cite> button on the right side.
A new token account can be created. The tabs on the right side of the list of <cite>native treasury</cite> addresses
show a list of processed transactions. The <cite>Rules</cite> tab provides a way to change <cite>Governance</cite> parameters
(similar to the <cite>Params</cite> subpage), and the <cite>Treasury</cite> and <cite>NFTs</cite> tabs provide information about the assets.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/05_03_dao_wallets.png “Governance wallets screen”)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>Programs</strong> - This section allows the user to manage the <cite>upgrade authority</cite> of programs and do code upgrades.</dt><dd><p>The <cite>New program</cite> button creates a new program type <cite>Governance</cite> (see _Different types of <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">governances_</span></a>)
and takes over management power for the program.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/06_04_programs.png “Programs screen”)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt><strong>New proposal</strong> - The last section we will touch on is the <cite>New proposal</cite> screen. Here, the user can create</dt><dd><p>a new proposal that can be chosen from a list of common proposals (such as mint token, transfer, etc.)
or pass a base64-encoded transaction as a proposal. The switch <cite>Vote by council</cite> defines if the proposal will be created
as a council or community proposal (a council proposal is voted on only by the council and vice versa).
At <cite>Preview transaction</cite> button, the user can check the instruction by simulating it.
The <cite>Add proposal</cite> button then creates a new proposal that is eventually listed on the main configuration page.</p>
<p>![Image](/img/deep-dive/07_05_custom_transaction_proposal.png “Transaction proposal screen”)</p>

<p>## Conclusion</p>
<p>In this article, we have discussed the SPL Governance Program and its main concepts. We have also touched on the
UI and its main features. We hope that this article will help you understand the SPL Governance Program better.</p>
