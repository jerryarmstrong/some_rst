<p>title: What are Solana Programs?
description: “A Solana Program, aka smart contract, is the executable code that interprets the instructions on the blockchain. There are two types: Native and on chain.”
—</p>
<p>Solana Programs, often referred to as “_smart <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">contracts_</span></a>” on other blockchains, are the executable code that interprets the instructions sent inside of each transaction on the blockchain. They can be deployed directly into the core of the network as [Native Programs](#native-programs), or published by anyone as [On Chain Programs](#on-chain-programs). Programs are the core building blocks of the network and handle everything from sending tokens between wallets, to accepting votes of a DAOs, to tracking ownership of NFTs.</p>
<p>Both types of programs run on top of the [Sealevel runtime](<a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192">https://medium.com/solana-labs/sealevel-parallel-processing-thousands-of-smart-contracts-d814b378192</a>), which is Solana’s _parallel <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">processing_</span></a> model that helps to enable the high transactions speeds of the blockchain.</p>
<p>## Key points</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Programs are essentially special type of [Accounts](../programming-model/accounts.md) that is marked as “_executable_”</p></li>
<li><p>Programs can own other Accounts</p></li>
<li><p>Programs can only _change the <a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">data_</span></a> or _debit_ accounts they own</p></li>
<li><p>Any program can _read_ or _credit_ another account</p></li>
<li><p>Programs are considered stateless since the primary data stored in a program account is the compiled SBF code</p></li>
<li><p>Programs can be upgraded by their owner (see more on that below)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Types of programs</p>
<p>The Solana blockchain has two types of programs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Native programs</p></li>
<li><p>On chain programs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>### On chain programs</p>
<p>These user written programs, often referred to as “_smart <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">contracts_</span></a>” on other blockchains, are deployed directly to the blockchain for anyone to interact with and execute. Hence the name “on chain”!</p>
<p>In effect, “on chain programs” are any program that is not baked directly into the Solana cluster’s core code (like the native programs discussed below).</p>
<p>And even though Solana Labs maintains a small subset of these on chain programs (collectively known as the [Solana Program Library](<a class="reference external" href="https://spl.solana.com/">https://spl.solana.com/</a>)), anyone can create or publish one. On chain programs can also be updated directly on the blockchain by the respective program’s Account owner.</p>
<p>### Native programs</p>
<p>_Native <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">programs_</span></a> are programs that are built directly into the core of the Solana blockchain.</p>
<p>Similar to other “on chain” programs in Solana, native programs can be called by any other program/user. However, they can only be upgraded as part of the core blockchain and cluster updates. These native program upgrades are controlled via the releases to the [different clusters](../../cluster/overview.md).</p>
<p>#### Examples of native programs include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>[System Program](../runtime-facilities/programs.md#system-program): Create new accounts, transfer tokens, and more</p></li>
<li><p>[BPF Loader Program](../runtime-facilities/programs.md#bpf-loader): Deploys, upgrades, and executes programs on chain</p></li>
<li><p>[Vote program](../runtime-facilities/programs.md#vote-program): Create and manage accounts that track validator voting state and rewards.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Executable</p>
<p>When a Solana program is deployed onto the network, it is marked as “executable” by the [BPF Loader Program](../runtime-facilities/programs.md#bpf-loader). This allows the Solana runtime to efficiently and properly execute the compiled program code.</p>
<p>## Upgradable</p>
<p>Unlike other blockchains, Solana programs can be upgraded after they are deployed to the network.</p>
<p>Native programs can only be upgraded as part of cluster updates when new software releases are made.</p>
<p>On chain programs can be upgraded by the account that is marked as the “_Upgrade <a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">Authority_</span></a>”, which is usually the Solana account/address that deployed the program to begin with.</p>
