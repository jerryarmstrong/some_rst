<p>title: Optimistic Confirmation and Slashing
—</p>
<p>Progress on optimistic confirmation can be tracked here</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/projects/52">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/projects/52</a></p>
<p>At the end of May, the mainnet-beta is moving to 1.1, and testnet is
moving to 1.2. With 1.2, testnet will behave as if it has optimistic
finality as long as at least no more than 4.66% of the validators are
acting maliciously. Applications can assume that 2/3+ votes observed in
gossip confirm a block or that at least 4.66% of the network is violating
the protocol.</p>
<p>## How does it work?</p>
<p>The general idea is that validators must continue voting following their
last fork, unless the validator can construct a proof that their current
fork may not reach finality. The way validators construct this proof is
by collecting votes for all the forks excluding their own. If the set
of valid votes represents over 1/3+X of the epoch stake weight, there
may not be a way for the validators current fork to reach 2/3+ finality.
The validator hashes the proof (creates a witness) and submits it with
their vote for the alternative fork. But if 2/3+ votes for the same
block, it is impossible for any of the validators to construct this proof,
and therefore no validator is able to switch forks and this block will
be eventually finalized.</p>
<p>## Tradeoffs</p>
<p>The safety margin is 1/3+X, where X represents the minimum amount of stake
that will be slashed in case the protocol is violated. The tradeoff is
that liveness is now reduced by 2X in the worst case. If more than 1/3 -
2X of the network is unavailable, the network may stall and will only
resume finalizing blocks after the network recovers below 1/3 - 2X of
failing nodes. So far, we haven’t observed a large unavailability hit
on our mainnet, cosmos, or tezos. For our network, which is primarily
composed of high availability systems, this seems unlikely. Currently,
we have set the threshold percentage to 4.66%, which means that if 23.68%
have failed the network may stop finalizing blocks. For our network,
which is primarily composed of high availability systems, a 23.68% drop
in availability seems unlikely. 1:10^12 odds, assuming five 4.7% staked
nodes with 0.995 uptime.</p>
<p>## Security</p>
<p>Long term average votes per slot has been 670,000,000 votes / 12,000,000
slots, or 55 out of 64 voting validators. This includes missed blocks due
to block producer failures. When a client sees 55/64, or ~86% confirming
a block, it can expect that ~24% or <cite>(86 - 66.666.. + 4.666..)%</cite> of
the network must be slashed for this block to fail full finalization.</p>
<p>## Why Solana?</p>
<p>This approach can be built on other networks, but the implementation
complexity is significantly reduced on Solana because our votes
have provable VDF-based timeouts. It’s not clear if switching proofs
can be easily constructed in networks with weak assumptions about
time.</p>
<p>## Slashing roadmap</p>
<p>Slashing is a hard problem, and it becomes harder when the goal of
the network is to have the lowest possible latency. The tradeoffs are
especially apparent when optimizing for latency. For example, ideally
validators should cast and propagate their votes before the
memory has been synced to disk, which means that the risk of local state
corruption is much higher.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, our goal for slashing is to slash 100% in cases where
the node is maliciously trying to violate safety rules and 0% during
routine operation. How we aim to achieve that is to first implement
slashing proofs without any automatic slashing whatsoever.</p>
<p>Right now, for regular consensus, after a safety violation, the
network will halt. We can analyze the data and figure out who was
responsible and propose that the stake should be slashed after
restart. A similar approach will be used with a optimistic conf.
An optimistic conf safety violation is easily observable, but under
normal circumstances, an optimistic confirmation safety violation
may not halt the network. Once the violation has been observed, the
validators will freeze the affected stake in the next epoch and
will decide on the next upgrade if the violation requires slashing.</p>
<p>In the long term, transactions should be able to recover a portion
of the slashing collateral if the optimistic safety violation is
proven. In that scenario, each block is effectively insured by the
network.</p>
