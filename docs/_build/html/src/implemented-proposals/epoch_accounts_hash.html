<p>title: Epoch Accounts Hash
—</p>
<p><em>Paraphrasing from https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/26847</em></p>
<p>## Background</p>
<p>Rent collection checks every account at least once per epoch.  At each slot, a
deterministic set of accounts (based on the pubkey range) is loaded, checked
for rent collection, and stored back to the Accounts DB at this new slot.</p>
<p>Accounts are stored (rewritten) _even <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">if_</span></a> they are unchanged.  This has a few
positive effects.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Once an account is rewritten, the previous version at an older slot is now
dead. As entire slots and AppendVecs become full of only dead accounts,
they can then be dropped/recycled.</p></li>
<li><p>Each account rewritten due to rent collection is included in that slot’s
bank hash.  Since the bank hash is part of what is voted on for consensus,
this means every account is verified by the network at least once per
epoch.</p></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, there is a big downside to rewriting unchanged accounts: performance.
Storing accounts can be very expensive.  And since accounts now are required to
be rent-exempt, the majority of accounts rewritten due to rent collection are
unchanged.  What if unchanged accounts were no longer rewritten? This would
minimally be a big performance win.</p>
<p>## Problem</p>
<p>If rent collection no longer is rewriting unchanged accounts, we lose the two
positive effects.  Dealing with Positive Effect 1 (from above) will be handled
by _Ancient <a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">AppendVecs_</span></a>, and will not be discussed here.  So how do we still
get the security from Positive Effect 2?  How can we still verify every account
at least once per epoch, <em>as part of consensus</em>, but without rewriting
accounts?</p>
<p>## Proposed Solution</p>
<p>Perform a full accounts hash calculation once per epoch, and hash the result
into a bank’s <cite>hash</cite>.  This will be known as the _Epoch Accounts <a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">Hash_</span></a>, or
_EAH_.</p>
<p>This retains the Positive Effect 2 from rent collection by checking every
account at least once per epoch.  Thus, any validators with missing, corrupt,
or extra accounts will identify those issues within 1-2 epochs.</p>
<p>### Implementation</p>
<p>Performing a full accounts hash takes a relatively long time to complete.  For
this reason, the EAH calculation must take place in the background.</p>
<p>In order for all the validators to calculate the same accounts hash, the
calculation must be based on the same view of all accounts.  This means the EAH
must be based on a predetermined slot.  This will be known as the <cite>start slot</cite>.
The <cite>start slot</cite> is calculated as an offset into the epoch.  This offset will
be known as the <cite>start offset</cite>.  Formally, the <cite>start slot</cite> is the first root
<em>greater-than-or-equal-to</em> <cite>first slot in epoch + start offset</cite>.</p>
<p>Similarly, all the validators must save the EAH into a bank at a predetermined
slot, and offset from the first slot of an epoch.  This will be known as the
<cite>stop slot</cite> and <cite>stop offset</cite>, respectively.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <cite>start offset</cite> will be set at one-quarter into the epoch.</p></li>
<li><p>The <cite>stop offset</cite> will be set at three-quarters into the epoch.</p></li>
<li><p>For epochs with 432,000 slots, the <cite>start offset</cite> will be 108,000 and the
<cite>stop offset</cite> will be 324,000.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These constants may be changed in the future, or may be determined at runtime.
The main justifications for these values are:
1. Do not start the EAH calculation at the beginning of an epoch, as the</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>beginning of an epoch is already a time of contention and stress.  There is
no reason to make this worse.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>The bank to save the EAH into—the <cite>stop offset</cite>—should be sufficiently far
in the future to guarantee all validators are able to complete the accounts
hash calculation in time.</p></li>
<li><p>The <cite>start offset</cite> should be <em>after</em> the <cite>rewarding interval</cite>
(from [Partitioned Inflationary Rewards Distribution](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/27455">https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/27455</a>)).
This ensures stake rewards have been distributed and stored into the
accounts for this epoch.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once the EAH calculation is complete, it must be saved somewhere.  Since this
occurs in the background, there is not an associated <cite>Bank</cite> that would make
sense to save into.  Instead, a new field will be added to <cite>AccountsDb</cite> that
will store the EAH.  Later, the bank at slot <cite>stop slot</cite>†¹ will read the EAH from
<cite>AccountsDb</cite> and hash it into its own hash (aka _bank <a href="#id25"><span class="problematic" id="id26">hash_</span></a>).</p>
<p>EAH calculation will use the existing _accounts background <a href="#id27"><span class="problematic" id="id28">services_</span></a> (_ABS_) to
perform the actual calculation.  Requests for EAH calculation will be sent from
<cite>bank_forks::set_root()</cite>†², with a new request type to distinguish an EAH request
from a Snapshot request.  Since the EAH will be part of consensus, it is not
optional; EAH requests will have the highest priority in ABS, and will be
processed first/instead of other requests.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>†¹: More precisely, all banks where <cite>bank slot &gt;= stop slot</cite> and <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`</span></a>parent slot &lt;</dt><dd><p>stop slot` will include the EAH in their _bank <a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">hash_</span></a>.  This ensures EAH
handles forking around <cite>stop slot</cite>, since only one of these banks will end
up rooted.</p>
</dd>
<dt>†²: An EAH calculation will be requested when <cite>root bank slot &gt;= start slot</cite></dt><dd><p>and <cite>root parent slot &lt; start slot</cite>.  This handles the scenario where
validators call <cite>bank_forks::set_root()</cite> at different intervals.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>#### Details</p>
<p>#### Snapshots</p>
<p>A snapshot contains all the state necessary to reconstruct the cluster as of a
certain slot.  A snapshot may then need to contain the EAH so that the <cite>stop
slot</cite> can include it.  Consider the following scenarios within an epoch where a
snapshot is requested for slot <cite>X</cite>:</p>
<p>##### 1. <cite>X &gt;= first slot in epoch</cite> and <cite>X &lt; start slot</cite></p>
<p>Since the <cite>start slot</cite> has not been reached yet, there is nothing special to do
in order to take a snapshot in this scenario.</p>
<p>##### 2. <cite>X == start slot</cite></p>
<p>The EAH <em>must</em> be included in the snapshot.  Since the snapshot process always
calculates the accounts hash, no additional calculations are required.  The
accounts hash calculation result will be used both to store in the snapshot as
the EAH, and for the snapshot hash (which is used at load-time for verification).</p>
<p>##### 3. <cite>X &gt; start slot</cite> and <cite>X &lt; stop slot</cite></p>
<p>If a snapshot is requested to be created <em>after</em> the <cite>start slot</cite> but <em>before</em>
the EAH calculation has completed, then it will be impossible to create a
snapshot with the correct EAH.  The snapshot process will wait until the EAH
calculation has completed before proceeding.</p>
<p>##### 4. <cite>X == stop slot</cite></p>
<p>The EAH has been calculated for this epoch, and has been included in the <cite>stop
slot</cite> bank.  No further handling is required; the snapshot does not need to
contain the EAH.</p>
<p>##### 5. <cite>X &gt; stop slot</cite> and <cite>X &lt;= last slot in epoch</cite></p>
<p>Same as (4).</p>
<p>#### Snapshot Verification</p>
<p>If a snapshot archive includes an EAH, we want to verify the EAH is correct at
load time (instead of waiting until <cite>stop slot</cite>, which could be far in the
future).</p>
<p>If the snapshot archive is for a slot within the <cite>calculation window</cite>†¹, then it
<em>must</em> include an EAH.  The snapshot hash itself will now also incorporate the
EAH.  In pseudo code:
<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">``</span></a><a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`</span></a>pseudo
if slot is in calculation window</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>let snapshot hash = hash(accounts hash, epoch accounts hash)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>else</dt><dd><p>let snapshot hash = accounts hash</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>endif
<a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">``</span></a>`
Since loading from a snapshot archive already verifies the snapshot archive’s
hash against the deserialized bank, the EAH will be implicitly verified as
well.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>†¹: The <cite>calculation window</cite> is <cite>[start slot, stop slot)</cite>, based on the epoch</dt><dd><p>of the referenced <cite>Bank</cite>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>#### Corner Cases</p>
<p>#### Minimum Slots per Epoch</p>
<p>An EAH is requested by <cite>BankForks::set_root()</cite>, which happens while setting
<em>roots</em>.  The EAH is stored into <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">`</span></a>Bank`s when they are <em>frozen</em>.  Banks are
frozen <em>at least</em> 32 slots before they are rooted.  For the expected behavior,
the EAH start slot really should be 32 slots before the stop slot. If the
number of slots per epoch is small, this can result in surprising behavior.</p>
<p>Example: Assume there are 40 slots per epoch.  The EAH start offset is 10, and
the EAH stop offset is 30.  When Bank 30 is frozen it will include the EAH in
its hash.  However, Bank 10 has not yet been rooted, so a new EAH has not been
calculated for this epoch.  This means Bank 30 will have included the EAH <em>from
the previous epoch</em> in its hash.</p>
<p>Later, when Bank 10 is rooted, it will request a new EAH be calculated.  If a
snapshot is taken for Bank 12 (or any bank between 10 and 30), it will include
the EAH <em>from this epoch</em>.  If a node loads the snapshot from Bank 12, once it
gets to freezing Bank 30, it will end up with a different bank hash since it
included the EAH from this epoch (versus the other node’s Bank 30 included the
EAH from the previous epoch).  Different bank hashes will result in consensus
failures.</p>
<p>The above example is clearly bad.  It can be observed that short epochs only
occur (1) during warmup, or (2) in tests.  Real clusters have much longer
epochs (432,000 slots by default).</p>
<p>Tests can be fixed as needed; that leaves fixing warmup.  Since warmup is
transient, we disable EAH until slots-per-epoch is large enough.  More
precisely, we disable EAH until the <cite>calculation window</cite> is big enough.  During
warmup, slots-per-epoch doubles each epoch until reaching the desired number,
so only a few epochs will skip EAH (which also is a small total number of
slots).</p>
<p>#### Warping</p>
<p>Warping introduces corner cases into EAH because many slots may be skipped,
including the entire range of <cite>start slot</cite> to <cite>stop slot</cite>.</p>
<p>Now, a new EAH will always be calculated based on the parent.  Thus, if the
warp slot is <cite>stop slot</cite> or greater (and the parent slot is less than <cite>stop
slot</cite>), the warp bank will include this newly-calculated EAH.  This is safe
because warping cannot be used on a live cluster; only for a new cluster or
tests/debugging.  Therefore _when_ the EAH was calculated is not germane.</p>
<p>For specific examples, refer to Appendix A.</p>
<p>#### Implementation Alternatives</p>
<p>##### Perform the EAH calculation in the foreground</p>
<p>The accounts hash calculation takes around 15 seconds (median, on Mainnet-Beta
today).  This is far beyond the slot time; this would be bad UX, and also
decrease network stability.</p>
<p>##### Remove <cite>stop offset</cite></p>
<p>Instead of having two offsets—one for <cite>start</cite> and one for <cite>stop</cite>—use a single
offset for both.  This delays when the EAH is saved into a Bank and voted on.
The saved EAH is now the EAH from the previous epoch.  This could work; would
reduce the number of “special” slots from two to one.  No significant
advantages observed.</p>
<p>##### Send EAH requests when making a new bank, instead of a new root</p>
<p>When a bank is created, we don’t yet know if it will be finalized until it is
rooted, which could result in multiple EAH requests due to forking.  This would
be bad for performance.</p>

the scenarios below:</p>

<p>#### parent slot: <cite>A</cite>, warp slot: <cite>A</cite></p>
<p>No slots important to the EAH have been skipped, so no change in behavior.</p>
<p>#### parent slot: <cite>A</cite>, warp slot: <cite>B</cite></p>
<p>An EAH calculation will be requested when the warp slot is rooted, and then

<p>#### parent slot: <cite>A</cite>, warp slot: <cite>C</cite> or <cite>D</cite></p>

<p>#### parent slot: <cite>A</cite>, warp slot: <cite>E</cite></p>
<p>Similar to <cite>A -&gt; C</cite>, the warp slot will include the EAH calculated at the

normal behavior.</p>
<p>#### parent slot: <cite>B</cite>, warp slot: <cite>B</cite></p>
<p>A new EAH will be calculated at parent slot, which will be included in <cite>stop

is different.</p>
<p>#### parent slot: <cite>B</cite>, warp slot: <cite>C</cite> or <cite>D</cite></p>
<p>The warp slot will include the EAH calculated at the parent slot, _not_ the
previously-calculated EAH from <cite>start slot 1</cite>.  This is different from normal

<p>And similar to <cite>A -&gt; E</cite>, when the warp slot is rooted, a new EAH calculation
will be requested, which will be included in <cite>stop slot 2</cite>.  This behavior is
expected.</p>
<p>#### parent slot: <cite>B</cite>, warp slot: <cite>F</cite></p>
<p>Similar to <cite>B -&gt; C</cite>, the warp slot will include the EAH calculated at the parent
