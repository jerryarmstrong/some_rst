<p>title: State Compression
description:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>‘State Compression is the method of cheaply and securely storing
“fingerprints” of off-chain data in the Solana leger, instead of expensive
accounts.’</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>—</p>
<p>On Solana, [State Compression](./state-compression.md) is the method of creating
a “fingerprint” (or hash) of off-chain data and storing this fingerprint
on-chain for secure verification. Effectively using the security of the Solana
ledger to securely validate off-chain data, verifying it has not been tampered
with.</p>
<p>This method of “compression” allows Solana programs and dApps to use cheap
blockchain [ledger](./../terminology.md#ledger) space, instead of the more
expensive [account](./../terminology.md#account) space, to securely store data.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by using a special binary tree structure, known as a
[concurrent merkle tree](#what-is-a-concurrent-merkle-tree), to create a hash of
each piece of data (called a <cite>leaf</cite>), hashing those together, and only storing
this final hash on-chain.</p>
<p>## What is State Compression?</p>
<p>In simple terms, state compression uses “<strong>_tree_</strong>” structures to
cryptographically hash off-chain data together, in a deterministic way, to
compute a single final hash that gets stored on-chain.</p>
<p>These _trees_ are created in this “_deterministic_” process by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>taking any piece of data</p></li>
<li><p>creating a hash of this data</p></li>
<li><p>storing this hash as a <cite>leaf</cite> the bottom of the tree</p></li>
<li><p>each <cite>leaf</cite> pair is then hash together, creating a <cite>branch</cite></p></li>
<li><p>each <cite>branch</cite> is then hash together</p></li>
<li><p>continually climbing the tree and hashing adjacent branches together</p></li>
<li><p>once at the top of the tree, a final <cite>root hash</cite> is produced</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This <cite>root hash</cite> is then stored on chain, as a verifiable <strong>_proof_</strong> of all of
the data within every leaf. Allowing anyone to cryptographically verify all the
off-chain data within the tree, while only actually storing a <strong>minimal</strong> amount
of data on-chain. Therefore, significantly reducing the cost to store/prove
large amounts of data due to this “state compression”.</p>
<p>## Merkle trees and concurrent merkle trees</p>
<p>Solana’s state compression used a special type of
[merkle tree](#what-is-a-merkle-tree) that allows for multiple changes to any
given tree to happen, while still maintaining the integrity and validity of the
tree.</p>
<p>This special tree, known as a
“[concurrent merkle tree](#what-is-a-concurrent-merkle-tree)”, effectively
retains a “changelog” of the tree on-chain. Allowing for multiple rapid changes
to the same tree (i.e. all in the same block), before a proof is invalidated.</p>
<p>### What is a merkle tree?</p>
<p>A [merkle tree](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkle_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merkle_tree</a>), sometimes called a
“hash tree”, is a hash based binary tree structure where each <cite>leaf</cite> node is
represented as a cryptographic hash of its inner data. And every node that is
<strong>not</strong> a leaf, called a <cite>branch</cite>, is represented as a hash of its child leaf
hashes.</p>
<p>Each branch is then also hashed together, climbing the tree, until eventually
only a single hash remains. This final hash, called the <cite>root hash</cite> or “root”,
can then be used in combination with a “proof path” to verify any piece of data
stored within a leaf node.</p>
<p>Once a final <cite>root hash</cite> has been computed, any piece of data stored within a
<cite>leaf</cite> node can be verified by rehashing the specific leaf’s data and the hash
label of each adjacent branch climbing the tree (known as the <cite>proof</cite> or “proof
path”). Comparing this “rehash” to the <cite>root hash</cite> is the verification of the
underlying leaf data. If they match, the data is verified accurate. If they do
not match, the leaf data was changed.</p>
<p>Whenever desired, the original leaf data can be changed by simply hashing the
<strong>new leaf</strong> data and recomputing the root hash in the same manner of the
original root. This <strong>new root hash</strong> is then used to verify any of the data,
and effectively invalidates the previous root hash and previous proof.
Therefore, each change to these _traditional merkle <a href="#id18"><span class="problematic" id="id19">trees_</span></a> are required to be
performed in series.</p>
<p>:::info</p>
<p>This process of changing leaf data, and computing a new root hash can be a
<strong>very common</strong> thing when using merkle trees! While it is one of the design
points of the tree, it can result in one of the most notable drawbacks: rapid
changes.</p>
<p>::</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">### What is a Concurrent merkle tree?</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In high throughput applications, like within the
[Solana runtime](/src/validator/runtime.md), requests to change an on-chain
_traditional merkle <a href="#id20"><span class="problematic" id="id21">tree_</span></a> could be received by validators in relatively rapid
succession (e.g. within the same slot). Each leaf data change would still be
required to performed in series. Resulting in each subsequent request for change
to fail, due to the root hash and proof being invalidated by the previous change
request in the slot.</p>
<p>Enter, Concurrent merkle trees.</p>
<p>A <strong>Concurrent merkle tree</strong> stores a <strong>secure changelog</strong> of the most recent
changes, their root hash, and the proof to derive it. This changelog “buffer” is
stored on-chain in an account specific to each tree, with a maximum number of
changelog “records” (aka <cite>maxBufferSize</cite>).</p>
<p>When multiple leaf data change requests are received by validators in the same
slot, the on-chain _concurrent merkle <a href="#id22"><span class="problematic" id="id23">tree_</span></a> can use this “changelog buffer” as a
source of truth for more acceptable proofs. Effectively allowing for up to
<cite>maxBufferSize</cite> changes to the same tree in the same slot. Significantly
boosting throughput.</p>
<p>## Sizing a concurrent merkle tree</p>
<p>When creating one of these on-chain trees, there are 3 values that will
determine the size of your tree, the cost to create your tree, and the number of
concurrent changes to your tree:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>max depth</p></li>
<li><p>max buffer size</p></li>
<li><p>canopy depth</p></li>
</ol>
<p>### Max depth</p>
<p>The “max depth” of a tree is the <strong>maximum number</strong> of hops to get from any data
<cite>leaf</cite> to the <cite>root</cite> of the tree.</p>
<p>Since merkle trees are binary trees, every leaf is connected to <strong>only one</strong>
other leaf; existing as a <cite>leaf pair</cite>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the <cite>maxDepth</cite> of a tree is used to determine the maximum number of
nodes (aka pieces of data or <cite>leafs</cite>) to store within the tree using a simple
calculation:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">`</span>
<span class="pre">nodes_count</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">^</span> <span class="pre">maxDepth</span>
<span class="pre">`</span></code></p>
<p>Since a trees depth must be set at tree creation, you must decide how many
pieces of data you want your tree to store. Then using the simple calculation
above, you can determine the lowest <cite>maxDepth</cite> to store your data.</p>
<p>#### Example 1: minting 100 nfts</p>
<p>If you wanted to create a tree to store 100 compressed nfts, we will need a
minimum of “100 leafs” or “100 nodes”.</p>
<p><a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a>`
// maxDepth=6 -&gt; 64 nodes
2^6 = 64</p>
<p>// maxDepth=7 -&gt; 128 nodes
2^7 = 128
<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">``</span></a><a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`</span></a></p>
<p>We must use a <cite>maxDepth</cite> of <cite>7</cite> to ensure we can store all of our data.</p>
<p>#### Example 2: minting 15000 nfts</p>
<p>If you wanted to create a tree to store 15000 compressed nfts, we will need a
minimum of “15000 leafs” or “15000 nodes”.</p>
<p><a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">``</span></a>`
// maxDepth=13 -&gt; 8192 nodes
2^13 = 8192</p>
<p>// maxDepth=14 -&gt; 16384 nodes
2^14 = 16384
<a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">``</span></a><a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">`</span></a></p>
<p>We must use a <cite>maxDepth</cite> of <cite>14</cite> to ensure we can store all of our data.</p>
<p>#### The higher the max depth, the higher the cost</p>
<p>The <cite>maxDepth</cite> value will be one of the primary drivers of cost when creating a
tree since you will pay this cost upfront at tree creation. The higher the max
tree depth depth, the more data fingerprints (aka hashes) you can store, the
higher the cost.</p>
<p>### Max buffer size</p>
<p>The “max buffer size” is effectively the maximum number of changes that can
occur on a tree, with the <cite>root hash</cite> still being valid.</p>
<p>Due to the root hash effectively being a single hash of all leaf data, changing
any single leaf would invalidate the proof needed for all subsequent attempts to
change any leaf of a regular tree.</p>
<p>But with a [concurrent tree](#what-is-a-concurrent-merkle-tree), there is
effectively a changelog of updates for these proofs. This changelog buffer is
sized and set at tree creation via this <cite>maxBufferSize</cite> value.</p>
<p>### Canopy depth</p>
<p>The “canopy depth”, sometimes called the canopy size, is the number of proof
nodes that are cached/stored on-chain for any given proof path.</p>
<p>When performing an update action on a <cite>leaf</cite>, like transferring ownership (e.g.
selling a compressed NFT), the <strong>complete</strong> proof path must be used to verify
original ownership of the leaf and therefore allow for the update action. This
verification is performed using the <strong>complete</strong> proof path to correctly compute
the current <cite>root hash</cite> (or any cached <cite>root hash</cite> via the on-chain “concurrent
buffer”).</p>
<p>The larger a tree’s max depth is, the more proof nodes are required to perform
this verification. For example, if your max depth is <cite>14</cite>, there are <cite>14</cite> total
proof nodes required to be used to verify. As a tree gets larger, the complete
proof path gets larger.</p>
<p>Normally, each of these proof nodes would be required to be included within each
tree update transaction. Since each proof node value takes up <cite>32 bytes</cite> in a
transaction (similar to providing a Public Key), larger trees would very quickly
exceed the maximum transaction size limit.</p>
<p>Enter the canopy. The canopy enables storing a set number of proof nodes on
chain (for any given proof path). Allowing for less proof nodes to be included
within each update transactions, therefore keeping the overall transaction size
below the limit.</p>
<p>For example, a tree with a max depth of <cite>14</cite> would require <cite>14</cite> total proof
nodes. With a canopy of <cite>10</cite>, only <cite>4</cite> proof nodes are required to be submitted
per update transaction.</p>
<p>#### The larger the canopy depth value, the higher the cost</p>
<p>The <cite>canopyDepth</cite> value is also a primary factor of cost when creating a tree
since you will pay this cost upfront at tree creation. The higher the canopy
depth, the more data proof nodes are stored on chain, the higher the cost.</p>
<p>#### Smaller canopy limits composability</p>
<p>While a tree’s creation costs are higher with a higher canopy, having a lower
<cite>canopyDepth</cite> will require more proof nodes to be included within each update
transaction. The more nodes required to be submitted, the larger the transaction
size, and therefore the easier it is to exceed the transaction size limits.</p>
<p>This will also be the case for any other Solana program or dApp that attempts to
interact with your tree/leafs. If your tree requires too many proof nodes
(because of a low canopy depth), then any other additional actions another
on-chain program <strong>could</strong> offer will be <strong>limited</strong> by their specific
instruction size plus your proof node list size. Limiting composability, and
potential additional utility for your specific tree.</p>
<p>For example, if your tree is being used for compressed NFTs and has a very low
canopy depth, an NFT marketplace may only be able to support simple NFTs
transfers. And not be able to support an on-chain bidding system.</p>
<p>## Cost of creating a tree</p>
<p>The cost of creating a concurrent merkle tree is based on the tree’s size
parameters: <cite>maxDepth</cite>, <cite>maxBufferSize</cite>, and <cite>canopyDepth</cite>. These values are all
used to calculate the on-chain storage (in bytes) required for a tree to exist
on chain.</p>
<p>Once the required space (in bytes) has been calculated, and using the
[<cite>getMinimumBalanceForRentExemption</cite>](/api/http#getminimumbalanceforrentexemption)
RPC method, request the cost (in lamports) to allocate this amount of bytes
on-chain.</p>
<p>### Calculate tree cost in JavaScript</p>
<p>Within the
[<cite>&#64;solana/spl-account-compression</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/&#64;solana/spl-account-compression">https://www.npmjs.com/package/&#64;solana/spl-account-compression</a>)
package, developers can use the
[<cite>getConcurrentMerkleTreeAccountSize</cite>](<a class="reference external" href="https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/account-compression/sdk/docs/modules/index.html#getConcurrentMerkleTreeAccountSize">https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-program-library/account-compression/sdk/docs/modules/index.html#getConcurrentMerkleTreeAccountSize</a>)
function to calculate the required space for a given tree size parameters.</p>
<p>Then using the

function to get the final cost (in lamports) to allocate the required space for
the tree on-chain.</p>
<p>Then determine the cost in lamports to make an account of this size rent exempt,

<p>### Example costs</p>
<p>Listed below are several example costs, for different tree sizes, including how
many leaf nodes are possible for each:</p>
<p><strong>Example #1: 16,384 nodes costing 0.222 SOL</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>max depth of <cite>14</cite> and max buffer size of <cite>64</cite></p></li>

<p><strong>Example #2: 16,384 nodes costing 1.134 SOL</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>max depth of <cite>14</cite> and max buffer size of <cite>64</cite></p></li>
<li><p>maximum number of leaf nodes: <cite>16,384</cite></p></li>

<li><p>canopy depth of <cite>15</cite> costs approximately <cite>15.814 SOL</cite> to create</p></li>
</ul>
<p>## Compressed NFTs</p>
<p>Compressed NFTs are one of the most popular use cases for State Compression on
Solana. With compression, a one million NFT collection could be minted for
<cite>~50 SOL</cite>, vice <cite>~12,000 SOL</cite> for its uncompressed equivalent collection.</p>
