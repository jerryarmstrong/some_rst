</div>
<p><cite>solana-farm-client</cite> is a client-side command-line tool for interacting with liquidity Pools, Farms, Vaults, and Funds. It can also print on-chain metadata and perform general operations with tokens, system accounts, and governance.
Under the hood, it leverages [Rust Client](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/rust_client.md">https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/rust_client.md</a>), but alternatively, the same functionality can be achieved by using [HTTP Client](<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/http_client.md">https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/http_client.md</a>) or by sending raw instructions.</p>
<p>All commands handled by <cite>solana-farm-client</cite> don’t require Main Router admin or Fund manager privileges.</p>
