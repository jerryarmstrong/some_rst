    # Solana Farms

**_This repository is EOL and no longer maintained._**

## Introduction

Solana Farms is a collection of easy-to-use tools and blockchain contracts for yield optimization strategies.

It is powered by the Solana blockchain to allow for frequent automatic compounding, staking, and rebalancing.

One of the distinct features of this platform is the on-chain Reference Database. Metadata for all objects: Tokens, Pools, Farms, Vaults, Funds, etc., is stored in the blockchain, so clients don't need any state or hard-coded data.

Solana Farms provides a unified interface to Funds, Vaults, regular AMM Pools, Farms, and basic operations on tokens and accounts. Raydium, Saber, and Orca protocols are currently supported.

This source code is an example that third parties can utilize to create and use their own version of a yield farming or aggregation service.
