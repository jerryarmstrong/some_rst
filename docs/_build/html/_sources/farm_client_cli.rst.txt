    # Farm Client CLI

`solana-farm-client` is a client-side command-line tool for interacting with liquidity Pools, Farms, Vaults, and Funds. It can also print on-chain metadata and perform general operations with tokens, system accounts, and governance.
Under the hood, it leverages [Rust Client](https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/rust_client.md), but alternatively, the same functionality can be achieved by using [HTTP Client](https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/http_client.md) or by sending raw instructions.

All commands handled by `solana-farm-client` don't require Main Router admin or Fund manager privileges.
