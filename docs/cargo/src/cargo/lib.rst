//! # Cargo as a library
//!
//! Cargo, the Rust package manager, is also provided as a library.
//!
//! There are two places you can find API documentation of cargo-the-library,
//!
//! - <https://docs.rs/cargo> and
//! - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo>.
//!
//! Each of them targets on a slightly different audience.
//!
//! ## For external tool developers
//!
//! The documentation on <https://docs.rs/cargo> contains public-facing items in cargo-the-library.
//! External tool developers may find it useful when trying to reuse existing building blocks from Cargo.
//! However, using Cargo as a library has drawbacks, especially cargo-the-library is unstable,
//! and there is no clear path to stabilize it soon at the time of writing.
//! See [The Cargo Book: External tools] for more on this topic.
//!
//! Cargo API documentation on docs.rs gets updates along with each Rust release.
//! Its version always has a 0 major version to state it is unstable.
//! The minor version is always +1 of rustc's minor version
//! (that is, `cargo 0.66.0` corresponds to `rustc 1.65`).
//!
//! ## For Cargo contributors
//!
//! The documentation on <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo> contains all items in Cargo.
//! Contributors of Cargo may find it useful as a reference of Cargo's implementation details.
//! It's built with `--document-private-items` rustdoc flag,
//! so you might expect to see some noise and strange items here.
//! The Cargo team and contributors strive for jotting down every details
//! from their brains in each issue and PR.
//! However, something might just disappear in the air with no reason.
//! This documentation can be seen as their extended minds,
//! sharing designs and hacks behind both public and private interfaces.
//!
//! If you are just diving into Cargo internals, [Cargo Architecture Overview]
//! is the best material to get a broader context of how Cargo works under the hood.
//! Things also worth a read are important concepts reside in source code,
//! which Cargo developers have been crafting for a while, namely
//!
//! - [`cargo::core::resolver`](crate::core::resolver),
//! - [`cargo::core::compiler::fingerprint`](core/compiler/fingerprint/index.html),
//! - [`cargo::util::config`](crate::util::config),
//! - [`cargo::ops::fix`](ops/fix/index.html), and
//! - [`cargo::sources::registry`](crate::sources::registry).
//!
//! This API documentation is published on each push of rust-lang/cargo master branch.
//! In other words, it always reflects the latest doc comments in source code on master branch.
//!
//! ## Contribute to Cargo documentations
//!
//! The Cargo team always continues improving all external and internal documentations.
//! If you spot anything could be better, don't hesitate to discuss with the team on
//! Zulip [`t-cargo` stream], or [submit an issue] right on GitHub.
//! There is also an issue label [`A-documenting-cargo-itself`],
//! which is generally for documenting user-facing [The Cargo Book],
//! but the Cargo team is welcome any form of enhancement for the [Cargo Contributor Guide]
//! and this API documentation as well.
