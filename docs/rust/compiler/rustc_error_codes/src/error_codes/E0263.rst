    #### Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

A lifetime was declared more than once in the same scope.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0403
fn foo<'a, 'b, 'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str, z: &'a str) { // error!
}
```

Two lifetimes cannot have the same name. To fix this example, change
the second `'a` lifetime into something else (`'c` for example):

```
fn foo<'a, 'b, 'c>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str, z: &'c str) { // ok!
}
```
