    //~^ ERROR cannot match against a tuple struct which contains private fields

    // (The below is a trick to allow compiler to infer a type for
    // variable `a` without attempting to ascribe a type to the
    // pattern or otherwise attempting to name the Box type, which
    // would run afoul of issue #22207)
