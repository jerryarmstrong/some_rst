    # Farm Control CLI

`solana-farm-ctrl` is a command-line tool for on-chain data management, Funds, and Vaults control. It can also generate metadata for Funds, Vaults, and their liquidity tokens.
Under the hood, it leverages [Rust Client](https://github.com/solana-labs/farms/blob/master/docs/rust_client.md), but alternatively, the same functionality can be achieved by executing instructions directly.

Most of the commands executed by `solana-farm-ctrl` require Main Router admin or Fund manager privileges. It is not intended to be used by the end-users. If multisig is enabled, different admins must execute the same command multiple times until the required number of signatures is collected.
