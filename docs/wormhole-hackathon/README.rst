    # Solana's Wormhole Hackathon &middot; Up to $200k in prizes
#### Boost your project at warp speed with Solana

* Hackathon dates: October 28th through November 14
* Type: Online and global
* More details: [Announcement Blog Post](https://medium.com/solana-labs/wormhole-solana-ethereum-bridge-d5502e944acb)
* Project submission form: [Submit here](https://solana.com/hackathon)

## Introduction
Solana is the fastest, low-fee, censorship-resistant blockchain designed to enable developers to permissionlessly build and scale applications to billions of users globally. Wormhole is the first bidirectional bridge that connects Ethereum with Solana. Wormhole allows new and existing crypto projects, businesses, and communities to move tokenized assets seamlessly across blockchains to benefit from Solana’s high speed (50,000 transactions per second) and low cost (less than $0.00001 per transaction). 

As long as you have an internet connection, you're invited to join our first global hackathon! Combining Wormhole with Solana’s core features gives hackers an open design space to create entirely new applications that could bring in the next wave of crypto users. While we encourage participants to build with Wormhole, hackers can build any application or tool they believe will have an impact on the ecosystem. The only requirement is that teams must incorporate Solana into their project in some way.  Take a look at our list of [ideas for inspiration](https://github.com/solana-labs/wormhole-hackathon/blob/main/ideas.md).

## Judging

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. Once all submissions are collected, Solana will distribute a list to the judges for the evaluation process. Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Functionality
2. Potential impact
3. Novelty
4. Design
5. Extensibility

After judges complete individual evaluations, the hackathon organizers will discuss with the judges to choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores. To culminate the hackathon, there will be a live-streamed event where the invited winners will present their project submissions. 

**Prizes**

| Place                                  | Prize                                        |
