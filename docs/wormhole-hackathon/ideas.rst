    # Hackathon Ideas

The Solana team has compiled a list of interesting ideas to explore during the hackathon. Below are a few requests for projects which outline some of those ideas in general terms.

## Explorers/Visualisers

-   Blockchain explorers and visualisers such as [https://txstreet.com, or gossip protocol messaging visualisers](https://txstreet.com)

-   GraphQL Support: Integrating directly into the Solana rust code to add a parallel GraphQL API that can be used in <https://explorer.solana.com>

## Tooling / Developer Experience

-   Name Service

-   A program that can accept any asset transfers to a name service. Including a table where the mint of a token can submit a name for their token. Also create a table where a token controls governance of the naming. 

-   SPL Token Minter: A simple interface for developers to launch their own SPL token

-   Debuggers: A tool that renders the core dump from the Solana module using the debug symbols from the library

-   Solana/Metamask Plugin via <https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-snaps-beta/wiki> 

-   Ethereum ORU's on Solana for Ethereum

-   Wallet UI/Visualisers: Portfolio charts for <https://sollet.io>

## DeFi

-   A Serum-related list can be found here: <https://projectserum.com/blog/project-ideas> 

-   Money market lending protocol native to Solana (akin to Compound or Aave)

-   Cross-Chain Lending: A lending protocol that immediately provides liquidity for assets transferred cross-chain - such that users don't need to wait for the cross-chain assets to be fully confirmed on both chains -  in return for a fee

-   Fixed Rate Loans: Where users can take out a fixed rate loan on an Ethereum Lending/Borrowing protocol that is enabled by an on-chain interest rate swap order book on Serum 

-   DeFi asset manager: A single interface consolidating all DeFi assets and liabilities across different platforms (and different chains) into one. 

-   DEX Aggregator: A cross-chain DEX aggregator that allows users to choose the best price for execution across multiple DeFi platforms, including cross-chain platforms. 

-   Build-your-own Liquidity Mining platform

-   Build out support for tokenized synthetic assets using Chainlink oracles and listing the SPL Synthetics on Serum

-   Oracles: An on-chain oracle that takes prices from Serum markets, does sophisticated risk and sanity checks on them, and creates a clean price feed that other projects working on Serum can use. Furthermore, once there are on-chain cross-chain bridges, those can be combined with this to create a fully on-chain cross-chain pricing oracle.

-   Fee Compare: A simple interface that tracks and compares cost to execute something given certain parameters across various DeFi platforms. Parameters include desired spread, transaction fees, trading pair setc. Can also track total value saved in transaction fees/spread

-   Creating Custom Markets on Serum: An interface to create custom markets on Serum from Ethereum. Including the set-up of decentralised market makers. 

-   Slashing Insurance: A simple insurance protocol where the community can provide insurance for validators against the risk of being slashed

-   Payments: A payments application for cross-chain conversion and transfers between Ethereum and Solana

## Gaming / NFT's

-   Cross-chain games: Multiplayer cross-chain games i.e. Snake/Pacman

-   On-chain text based games 

-   NFT (Games): Text-based games to generate unique NFT's (i.e. [http://monsterbreeder.com](http://monsterbreeder.com/)) 

-   NFT (Licensing): Build your own NFT, and a governance token for the NFT to control how the royalties are spent and who is licensed to play the song.

-   A port of Roguelike Open Source project: <https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/roguelike> transforming it into an on-chain multiplayer application

-   NFT generator: Allows creators to easily issue it to their community, tracking awards to specified wallets and logging history

-   On-chain advertisements: e.g. <http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/>

## Governance

-   Governance Platform: A governance oriented interface that can be used by any Solana application which can help communities submit, manage and discuss proposals, track on-chain votes and execute proposals etc. 

-   Build-Your-Own-DAO
