# Address Gate

## Overview

The **Address Gate** guard restricts the mint to a single address which must match the address of the minting wallet.

## Guard Settings

The Address Gate guard contains the following settings:

- **Address**: The only address that is allowed to mint from the Candy Machine.

<AccordionItem title="JavaScript — Umi library (recommended)" open={true}>
<div className="accordion-item-padding">

Here’s how we can set up a Candy Machine using the Address Gate guard.

```ts
create(umi, {
  // ...
  guards: {
    addressGate: some({ address: someWallet.publicKey }),
  },
});
```

Now, only `someWallet` will be able to mint from this Candy Machine.

Here’s how we can set up a Candy Machine using the Address Gate guard via the JS SDK.

```ts
const { candyMachine } = await metaplex.candyMachines().create({
  // ...
  guards: {
    addressGate: {
      address: someWallet.publicKey,
    },
  },
});
```

Now, only `someWallet` will be able to mint from this Candy Machine.
