    # Solana Foundation x Serum DeFi Hackathon &middot; Up to $400k in prizes
#### Bringing Blazing Speed, Low Fees, and Scalability to Decentralized Finance

* Hackathon deadline: March 1, 2021 | 11:59pm PT
* Type: Online and global
* Submission form: [Official Website](https://solana.com/defi)
* More details: [Announcement Blog Post](https://medium.com/solana-labs/announcing-the-solana-foundation-x-serum-defi-hackathon-7e34290f8262)

## Introduction
Solana is a fast, low-fee, and censorship-resistant blockchain designed to enable builders to quickly deploy and scale applications to billions of users globally. The Solana Foundation has teamed up with Serum, the largest DeFi project in the ecosystem, to host a hackathon focused on allowing developers to experiment and leverage our technology to create a plethora of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications.

As long as you have an Internet connection, you're invited to join the global hackathon! Combining Serum's infrastructure and tooling with Solana’s core features gives hackers an open design space to expand the overall DeFi ecosystem. While participants are encouraged to build novel DeFi apps, hackers can build infrastructure or any tool they believe will have an impact on the ecosystem. The only requirement is that teams must incorporate Solana into their project in some way.  Take a look at this list of [DeFi ideas for inspiration](https://github.com/solana-labs/defi-hackathon/blob/main/ideas.md).

## Judging

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. Once all submissions are collected, Solana will distribute a list to the judges for the evaluation process. Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Functionality
2. Potential impact
3. Novelty
4. Design + UX
5. Composability

After judges complete individual evaluations, the hackathon organizers will discuss with the judges to choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores. Winners of the event will be announced shortly after the end of the hackathon. 

Once winners have been selected, the top 9 teams will have the opportunity to compete for an additional $200k in seed funding. This gives serious builders a chance at jumping full-time into the Solana ecosystem and receive extensive resources from the Solana Foundation, Project Serum, and leading venture capital firms.

## Legal Disclaimer

The Solana Foundation x Serum DeFi Hackathon is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon.All participants must comply with applicable laws and regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of the Hackathon.

The Hackathon ideas and developer resources that Solana Foundation (“SF”) provides are for educational and inspirational purposes only. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications (including the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of the Commodities and Exchange Act.

The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Solana blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Solana blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Solana blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software.
