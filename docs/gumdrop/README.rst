    # Gumdrop 

See the [Metaplex Docs](https://docs.metaplex.com/airdrops/create-gumdrop) and the
[Example Deployment](https://gumdrop.metaplex.com/) for more information. The Gumdrop Program Rust code can be here: [MPL](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex-program-library/tree/master/gumdrop).

## Setup

Be sure to be running Node v14.17.6 and yarn version 1.22.10.

`yarn bootstrap`

Then run:

`yarn start`

You may have to rebuild your package more than one time to secure a
running environment.
