    /// An iterator that knows its exact length.
///
/// Many [`Iterator`]s don't know how many times they will iterate, but some do.
/// If an iterator knows how many times it can iterate, providing access to
/// that information can be useful. For example, if you want to iterate
/// backwards, a good start is to know where the end is.
///
/// When implementing an `ExactSizeIterator`, you must also implement
/// [`Iterator`]. When doing so, the implementation of [`Iterator::size_hint`]
/// *must* return the exact size of the iterator.
///
/// The [`len`] method has a default implementation, so you usually shouldn't
/// implement it. However, you may be able to provide a more performant
/// implementation than the default, so overriding it in this case makes sense.
///
/// [`len`]: ExactSizeIterator::len
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Basic usage:
///
/// ```
/// // a finite range knows exactly how many times it will iterate
/// let five = 0..5;
///
/// assert_eq!(5, five.len());
/// ```
///
/// In the [module-level docs], we implemented an [`Iterator`], `Counter`.
/// Let's implement `ExactSizeIterator` for it as well:
///
/// [module-level docs]: crate::iter
///
/// ```
/// # struct Counter {
/// #     count: usize,
/// # }
/// # impl Counter {
/// #     fn new() -> Counter {
/// #         Counter { count: 0 }
/// #     }
/// # }
/// # impl Iterator for Counter {
/// #     type Item = usize;
/// #     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
/// #         self.count += 1;
/// #         if self.count < 6 {
/// #             Some(self.count)
/// #         } else {
/// #             None
/// #         }
/// #     }
/// # }
/// impl ExactSizeIterator for Counter {
///     // We can easily calculate the remaining number of iterations.
///     fn len(&self) -> usize {
///         5 - self.count
///     }
/// }
///
/// // And now we can use it!
