The code in this file is responsible for uploading files to the Pinata IPFS service. It defines a `PinataMethod` struct that implements the `Prepare` and `ParallelUploader` traits, which are used to prepare and upload files in parallel to the IPFS network.

The `PinataMethod` struct contains an `Arc<Config>` which holds the configuration data required for uploading files, such as the API endpoint, content gateway, and parallel upload limit. The `new` function initializes a `PinataMethod` instance by validating the provided configuration data and setting up the required HTTP client with the necessary headers.

The `Prepare` trait implementation checks if any file in the given asset pairs exceeds the file size limit of 10MB. If any file is larger than the limit, an error is returned.

The `ParallelUploader` trait implementation defines the `parallel_limit` function, which returns the number of files that can be uploaded in parallel. The `upload_asset` function is responsible for uploading a single file to the IPFS network. It reads the file data, creates a multipart form with the file and additional options, and sends the form to the Pinata API endpoint. If the upload is successful, the function returns the asset ID and the generated URI for the uploaded file.

Here's an example of how the `PinataMethod` might be used in the larger project:

```rust
let config_data = ConfigData::load("config.toml")?;
let pinata_method = PinataMethod::new(&config_data).await?;

let asset_pairs = get_asset_pairs()?;
let asset_indices = get_asset_indices()?;

pinata_method.prepare(&sugar_config, &asset_pairs, asset_indices).await?;

let asset_info = AssetInfo::new(...);
let upload_handle = pinata_method.upload_asset(asset_info);
let (asset_id, uri) = upload_handle.await??;
```

This code snippet demonstrates loading the configuration data, initializing a `PinataMethod` instance, preparing the assets for upload, and uploading a single asset to the IPFS network.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `PinataMethod` struct and how is it initialized?
   **Answer:** The `PinataMethod` struct is used to store the configuration for interacting with the Pinata API. It is initialized using the `new` method, which takes a reference to `ConfigData` and sets up the client, endpoint, content gateway, and parallel limit based on the provided configuration.

2. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Prepare` trait implementation for `PinataMethod`?
   **Answer:** The `Prepare` trait implementation for `PinataMethod` is used to verify that no file is larger than 10MB before uploading, as files larger than 10MB are not currently supported. It checks the file size for each asset in the provided `asset_pairs` and returns an error if any file exceeds the limit.

3. **Question:** How does the `send` method in the `Config` struct work?
   **Answer:** The `send` method is responsible for uploading an asset to the Pinata API. It takes an `AssetInfo` struct as input, reads the data based on the asset's data type, creates a multipart form with the file and pinata options, and sends a POST request to the Pinata API endpoint. If the upload is successful, it returns the asset ID and the generated URI; otherwise, it returns an error with details about the failure.
