The code in this file is responsible for handling the storage and uploading of assets to the Shadow Drive, a decentralized storage solution. It provides a `SHDWMethod` struct that implements the `Prepare` and `ParallelUploader` traits, which are used to prepare and upload assets in parallel.

The `SHDWMethod` struct contains an `Arc<Config>` which holds the configuration data for the Shadow Drive, such as the endpoint, keypair, storage account, and storage information. The `new` method is used to create a new instance of `SHDWMethod` by initializing the configuration data from the given `SugarConfig` and `ConfigData`.

The `Prepare` trait implementation checks if there is enough storage space available in the Shadow Drive to store the assets. It calculates the total size of the assets to be uploaded and compares it with the reserved storage space. If there is not enough space, an error is returned.

The `ParallelUploader` trait implementation provides the `upload_asset` method, which is responsible for uploading a single asset to the Shadow Drive. It reads the asset data, calculates its hash, and signs a message with the user's keypair. Then, it creates a multipart form with the asset data, signature, and other required fields, and sends an HTTP POST request to the Shadow Drive's upload endpoint. If the upload is successful, it returns the asset ID and the URL of the uploaded asset.

Here's an example of how the `SHDWMethod` might be used in the larger project:

```rust
let shdw_method = SHDWMethod::new(&sugar_config, &config_data).await?;
shdw_method.prepare(&sugar_config, &assets, asset_indices).await?;

let asset_info = AssetInfo::new(...);
let upload_handle = shdw_method.upload_asset(asset_info);
let (asset_id, asset_url) = upload_handle.await??;
```

This code initializes a `SHDWMethod` instance, prepares the assets for upload, and then uploads a single asset in parallel. The resulting asset ID and URL can be used for further processing or storage.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `SHDWMethod` struct and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `SHDWMethod` struct is a wrapper around the `Config` struct, which holds the configuration for the Shadow Drive storage. It is used to implement the `Prepare` and `ParallelUploader` traits, which are responsible for preparing and uploading assets to the Shadow Drive storage.

2. **Question**: How does the `send` function in the `Config` struct work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer**: The `send` function is responsible for uploading an asset to the Shadow Drive storage. It takes an `AssetInfo` struct as input, reads the data from the asset, creates a hash of the asset name, signs a message with the storage account and keypair, and sends a multipart HTTP request to the Shadow Drive endpoint to upload the asset.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `Prepare` trait implementation for `SHDWMethod` and how does it work?
   **Answer**: The `Prepare` trait implementation for `SHDWMethod` is responsible for checking if there is enough storage space available in the Shadow Drive storage before uploading assets. It calculates the total size of the assets to be uploaded and compares it with the reserved storage space. If there is not enough space, it returns an error.
