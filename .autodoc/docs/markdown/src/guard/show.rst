The code in this file is responsible for displaying the configuration details of a Candy Guard in the Sugar project. A Candy Guard is a set of rules and conditions that must be met for a user to interact with a candy machine. The main function in this file is `process_guard_show(args: GuardShowArgs)`, which takes a `GuardShowArgs` struct as input and prints the configuration details of the specified Candy Guard.

The `GuardShowArgs` struct contains the following fields:
- `keypair`: An optional keypair for the user.
- `rpc_url`: An optional RPC URL for the Solana network.
- `cache`: A cache file containing the Candy Guard ID.
- `candy_guard`: An optional Candy Guard ID.

The `process_guard_show` function first retrieves the Candy Guard ID either from the provided `candy_guard` field or from the cache file. It then sets up the Sugar configuration and client using the provided keypair and RPC URL. The Candy Guard account and its data are fetched from the Solana network using the Candy Guard ID.

The function then prints the Candy Guard configuration details, including the base, bump, authority, and data fields. It also prints the details of the default Guard Set and any additional Guard Sets (groups) if they exist. Each Guard Set contains various conditions such as bot tax, SOL payment, token payment, start date, third-party signer, token gate, gatekeeper, end date, allow list, mint limit, NFT payment, redeemed amount, address gate, NFT gate, NFT burn, token burn, freeze SOL payment, and freeze token payment. The function prints the details of each condition if it exists in the Guard Set.

This code is useful for users who want to view the configuration of a Candy Guard in the Sugar project, which can help them understand the rules and conditions they need to meet to interact with a candy machine.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `process_guard_show` function and what are its input arguments?
   **Answer:** The `process_guard_show` function is responsible for displaying the candy guard configuration and its associated guard sets. It takes an input argument of type `GuardShowArgs`, which contains fields like `keypair`, `rpc_url`, `cache`, and `candy_guard`.

2. **Question:** How does the code handle the case when the candy guard ID is not provided or is empty?
   **Answer:** If the candy guard ID is not provided or is empty, the code returns an error with the message "Missing candy guard id.".

3. **Question:** How is the candy guard data loaded and displayed in the `process_guard_show` function?
   **Answer:** The candy guard data is loaded using the `CandyGuardData::load` function with the account data sliced from `DATA_OFFSET`. The data is then displayed using the `print_guard_set` function, which prints the guard set information with appropriate formatting and padding.
