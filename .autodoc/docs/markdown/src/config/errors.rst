The code provided defines a custom error type called `ConfigError` for the Sugar project. This error type is used to handle various configuration-related issues that may arise during the execution of the project. The `ConfigError` enum is derived from the `Debug` and `Error` traits, which allows it to be easily printed and used as a standard error type.

There are seven variants of the `ConfigError` enum, each representing a specific configuration error:

1. `ParseError`: This error occurs when the configuration file cannot be parsed. It takes a `String` as an argument, which provides additional information about the parsing error.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::ParseError("Invalid syntax".to_string()));`

2. `MissingFileError`: This error occurs when the configuration file is missing. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the missing file's name.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::MissingFileError("config.toml".to_string()));`

3. `InvalidPathError`: This error occurs when the configuration file path is invalid, such as when it points to a directory instead of a file. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the invalid path.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::InvalidPathError("/path/to/directory".to_string()));`

4. `PermissionError`: This error occurs when the configuration file cannot be opened due to insufficient permissions. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the file's path.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::PermissionError("/path/to/config.toml".to_string()));`

5. `InvalidCluster`: This error occurs when an invalid cluster is specified in the configuration. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the invalid cluster.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::InvalidCluster("unknown_cluster".to_string()));`

6. `InvalidUploadMethod`: This error occurs when an invalid upload method is specified in the configuration. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the invalid method.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::InvalidUploadMethod("unknown_method".to_string()));`

7. `InvalidTokenStandard`: This error occurs when an invalid token standard is specified in the configuration. It takes a `String` as an argument, which represents the invalid standard.

   Example usage: `return Err(ConfigError::InvalidTokenStandard("unknown_standard".to_string()));`

By using the `ConfigError` enum, the Sugar project can handle configuration-related errors in a more structured and informative way, making it easier to diagnose and fix issues.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ConfigError` enum and its variants?
   **Answer:** The `ConfigError` enum represents different types of errors that can occur while working with a configuration file in the Sugar project. Each variant corresponds to a specific error scenario, such as parsing errors, missing files, invalid paths, and more.

2. **Question:** How is the `thiserror` crate being used in this code?
   **Answer:** The `thiserror` crate is used to derive the `Error` trait for the `ConfigError` enum, which allows it to be used as a standard Rust error type. The `#[error()]` attribute is used to provide custom error messages for each variant of the enum.

3. **Question:** How can a developer handle these errors when using the Sugar project?
   **Answer:** When working with the Sugar project, a developer can handle these errors by matching on the `ConfigError` enum and taking appropriate action based on the specific error variant encountered. This can include displaying a helpful error message, retrying an operation, or gracefully exiting the program.
