The `sugar` code file provides functionality to display information about a candy machine, which is a part of a larger NFT minting project. The main function in this file is `process_show(args: ShowArgs)`, which takes a `ShowArgs` struct as input and returns a `Result<()>`. The `ShowArgs` struct contains information about the candy machine, such as its keypair, RPC URL, cache, and whether to display unminted tokens.

The `process_show` function starts by setting up the client and program for the candy machine using the provided arguments. It then loads the candy machine state and data, and prints various information about the candy machine, such as its ID, authority, mint authority, collection mint, token standard, rule set, and other properties.

If the `unminted` flag is set in the `ShowArgs` struct, the function also retrieves and displays a list of unminted indices for the candy machine. This is useful for users who want to know which tokens have not yet been minted.

The `print_with_style` function is a helper function used to print key-value pairs with a consistent formatting style. It takes an indent string, a key string, and a value that implements the `Display` trait, and prints them with a specific formatting style.

Overall, this code file provides a way for users to view detailed information about a candy machine, which can be helpful for managing and understanding the state of their NFT minting project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `process_show` function and what are its inputs and outputs?
   **Answer**: The `process_show` function is responsible for displaying information about a candy machine, such as its state, data, and unminted indices. It takes a `ShowArgs` struct as input, which contains various optional and required arguments, and returns a `Result<()>` indicating the success or failure of the operation.

2. **Question**: How does the `process_show` function handle different account versions and token standards?
   **Answer**: The `process_show` function checks the `cndy_state.version` and `cndy_state.token_standard` fields to determine the account version and token standard. It then prints the corresponding information based on these values, such as "V1" or "V2" for account version, and "NonFungible" or "ProgrammableNonFungible (pNFT)" for token standard.

3. **Question**: How does the `process_show` function retrieve and display the unminted indices of a candy machine?
   **Answer**: If the `args.unminted` flag is set to true, the `process_show` function calculates the start index for the unminted items and retrieves the raw candy machine data. It then iterates through the remaining items, extracts the indices, and sorts them. Finally, it prints the unminted indices in a formatted manner, with a maximum of `PER_LINE` indices per line.
