/**
 * The botTax guard charges a penalty for invalid transactions
 * in order to discourage bots from attempting to mint NFTs.
 *
 * This bot tax works in combinaison with other guards and
 * will trigger whenever a minting wallet attempts to mint
 * an NFT such that other guards would have rejected the mint.
 *
 * For example, if you have a startDate guard and a botTax guard,
 * anyone trying to mint before the defined start date will be
 * charged the bot tax instead of receiving a specific startDate error.
 *
 * The `lastInstruction` argument allows you to configure whether
 * or not we should charge the bot tax when a mint instruction
 * is not the last instruction of the transaction. This is
 * useful if you want to prevent bots from adding extra instructions
 * after minting to detect if a bot tax was charged and, in this case,
 * throw an error to make the transaction fail and avoid the bot tax.
